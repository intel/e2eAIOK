    "Transfer Learning Kit is a general and convenient framework for transfer knowledge from pretrained model and/or source domain data to target task. Its objectives are:\n",
    "* Transfer knowledge from pretrained model with the same/different network structure, which greatly speedups training without accuracy regression.\n",
    "* Transfer knowledge from source domain data without target label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy of Transfer Learning Kit is list below. And, there are 5 key components in our Transfer Learning Kit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tBackbone Factory: creates a backbone net according to predefined backbone or user-provided backbone to make basic prediction. \n",
    "2.\tTask Finetunner: creates a pretrained finetuning schema (called “finetunner”) to transfer knowledge from a pretrained model to target model with the same network structure.\n",
    "3.\tDomain Adapter: creates a domain adaption net (called “adapter”) to transfer knowledge from source domain to target domain.\n",
    "4.\tKnowledge Distiller: creates a knowledge distillation net (called “distiller”) to transfer knowledge from teacher model to target model. \n",
    "5.\tTransferrable Model: creates a customized and transferrable model which is a wrapper of backbone, adapter and distiller.\n",
