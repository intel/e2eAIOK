# [Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit]()

# INTRODUCTION

## Problem Statement

Modern End to End AI pipeline life cycle is quite complicate with a complex pipeline including data processing, feature engineering, model development, and model deployment & maintenance. The iterative nature for feature engineering, model testing and hyper-parameter optimization makes the process more time-consuming. This complexity creates an entry-barrier for novice and citizen data scientists who might not have such expertise or skills.  Meanwhile, people tend to develop larger and larger models to get better performance, which are quite often over-parameterized.  Those overparameterized models not only poses significant challenges on AI hardware infrastructure as they require expensive computation power for training, but also posed a challenge when try to deploy in resource constraint environment which is a common need. 

## Solution with Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit

Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit is a composable toolkits for E2E AI optimization to deliver high performance lightweight networks/models efficiently on commodity HW like CPU, intending to make E2E AI pipelines faster, easier and more accessible.

Making AI Faster: It reduces E2E time on CPU to an acceptable range throughput full pipeline optimization and improved scale-up/out capability on Intel platforms with Intel optimized framework and toolkits, delivers popular lighter DL Models with close enough performance and significantly higher inference throughput.

Making AI Easier: It automates provides simplified toolkits for data processing, distributed training, and compact neural network construction, automates E2E AI pipeline with click to run workflows and can be easily plugged to third party ML solutions/platforms as an independent composable component. 

Making AI more accessible:  Through built-in optimized, parameterized models generated by smart democratization advisor and domain-specific, neural architected search (NAS) based network constructure, it brings complex DL to commodity HW, everyone can easily access AI on existing CPU clusters without the need to be an expert on data engineering and data science. 

## This solution is intended for…

* Citizen Data Scientists will get access to a broad range of models with simplified, click to run E2E AI pipeline workflows. They can construct models using the neural architecture search rather than developing from scratch.
* Enterprise users can get optimized performance on CPU with simplified click to run workflow covering every stage of AI. 
* For independent software vendor, the optimized AI workflows can help to expand their AI portfolio and optimized End to End Pipeline reduced time to market. 
* For cloud service providers, they can use the neural network Constructor’s NAS feature to improve model performance and reduce search cost.

# ARCHITECTURE

## Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit
Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit is a composable toolkits for E2E AI optimization to deliver high performance lightweight networks/models efficiently on commodity HW. It is a pipeline framework that streamlines AI optimization technologies in each stage of E2E AI pipeline, including data processing, feature engineering, training, hyper-parameter tunning, and inference. Intel® End-to-End AI Optimization Kit delivers high performance, lightweight models efficiently on commodity hardware.

## The key components are:

* [RecDP](RecDP/README.md):  A parallel data processing and feature engineering lib on top of Spark, and extensible to other data processing tools. It provides abstraction API to hide Spark programming complexity, delivers optimized performance through adaptive query plan & strategy, supports critical feature engineering functions on Tabular dataset, and can be easily integrated to third party solutions.  

* [Smart Democratization advisor (SDA)](e2eAIOK/SDA/README.md): A user-guided tool to facilitate automation of built-in model democratization via parameterized models, it generates yaml files based on user choice, provided build-in intelligence through parameterized models and leverage SigOpt for HPO. SDA converts the manual model tuning and optimization to assisted autoML and autoHPO. SDA provides a list of build-in optimized models ranging from RecSys, CV, NLP, ASR and RL. 

* [Neural network constructor](#): A neural architecture search technology based on component to build compact neural network models for specific domains directly. It is a multi-model, hardware aware, train-free neural architecture search approach to build models for CV, NLP, ASR directly and leverage transfer learning model adaptor to deploy the models in user’s production environment.
