Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser , an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io .\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ·Deep Learning ·Layout Analysis\\n·Character Recognition ·Open Source library ·Toolkit.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [ 11,arXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021', 'metadata': {'page_label': '1', 'source': 'layout-parser-paper.pdf'}}\n",

DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [ 1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1.An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2.A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n3.Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n4.A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8,34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

The dhSegment [ 22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [ 28] and Mask R-CNN [ 12] are used for identifying document elements [ 38]\\nand detecting tables [ 30,26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [ 29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline.

Due to\\ndomain shift [ 7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples.

In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal\\noutputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\\nthe results into other pipelines.

Currently,\\nthree types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser , shown\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\nlikeshift ,pad, and scale , and operations like intersect ,union , and is_in ,\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\ntransformations like relative_to andcondition_on that transform coordinates\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\ndetailed description of these operations13.\\nBased on Coordinate s, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\nspecifying the reading orders via setting the parent ﬁeld to the index of the parent\\nobject. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlock s and supports\\nprocessing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\nlayout structures.

Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[ 33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [ 5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser ,\\nusers can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.', 'metadata': {'page_label': '9', 'source': 'layout-parser-paper.pdf'}}\n",

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines.

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\nefforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\n\\nThe library is publicly available at https: //layout-parser.github.io\\n\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis - Deep Learning - Layout Analysis\\n- Character Recognition - Open Source library - Toolkit.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification\\n\\n2 Z.
