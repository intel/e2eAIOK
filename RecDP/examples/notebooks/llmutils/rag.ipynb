Revenue for our reportable and non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines:   ▪       CCG includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2 in 1, thin-and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics.   ▪       DCAI includes a broad portfolio of central processing units (CPUs), domain-specific accelerators and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), designed to empower data center and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs.   ▪       NEX includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, telecommunications networks, on-premises edge, software and platforms.    ▪       Mobileye includes the development and deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.   ▪       IFS provides differentiated full stack solutions including wafer fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard and software.   We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.   We have an \"all other\" category that includes revenue, expenses and charges such as:   ▪       results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;   ▪       historical results of operations from divested businesses;    ▪       amounts included within restructuring and other charges;    ▪       employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and    ▪       acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.

This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.     |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Business Unit Revenue and Trends** |   | **Q3 2023** |   | **vs. Q3 2022** |   | | Client Computing Group (CCG) |   | $7.9 billion |   | down | 3% |   | | Data Center and AI (DCAI) |   | $3.8 billion |   | down | 10% |   | | Network and Edge (NEX) |   | $1.5 billion |   | down | 32% |   | | Mobileye |   | $530 million |   | up | 18% |   | | Intel Foundry Services (IFS) |   | $311 million |   | up | 299% |   |   **Business Highlights**       ▪       Intel remains on track to meet its goal of achieving five nodes in four years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Along with Intel 7, Intel 4, the company’s first node using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology, is now in high-volume manufacturing. Intel also achieved a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the release of the 0.9 PDK. In addition, Intel announced one of the industry’s first glass substrates for next-generation advanced packaging, planned for the latter part of this decade. This breakthrough achievement will enable the continued scaling of transistors in a package and advance Moore’s Law to deliver data-centric applications.   ▪       Continuing its investment in manufacturing capacity to create a geographically balanced, secure and resilient supply chain, Intel opened Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, during the quarter. Combined with the company’s planned wafer fabrication facility in Magdeburg, Germany, and planned assembly and test facility in Wrocław, Poland, this will help create a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing value chain in Europe.    ▪       This week, Intel shared its plans to begin installation of the world’s first high-NA EUV tool for commercial use by the end of the year to continue the company's modernization and infrastructure expansion of the Gordon Moore Park at Ronler Acres in Oregon, one of the world’s leading semiconductor innovation and productization centers.   ▪       Intel has submitted all four of its major manufacturing proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon, representing more than $100 billion of U.S. manufacturing and research investments, to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s CHIPS Program Office.\n",

      "    Business Outlook   Intel's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.\\*     |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Q4 2023** |   | **GAAP\\*** |   | **Non-GAAP\\*** | | Revenue |   | $14.6-15.6 billion |   | $14.6-15.6 billion^ | | Gross Margin |   | 43.3% |   | 46.5% | | Tax Rate |   | 5% |   | 13% | | Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Intel—Diluted |   | $0.23 |   | $0.44 |   ^ *No adjustment on a non-GAAP basis.*       Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. The gross margin and EPS outlook are based on the mid-point of the revenue range.   \\*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.2 billion. Intel expects this change will result in an approximately $2.5 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values.
