Background
==========

Over the last 50 years, the widespread usage of fluoridated water and fluoridated dentrifices have been cited as major reasons for a decline in caries since the early 1970s \[[@B1]\], and for the appearance of a significant association between oral hygiene and caries experience \[[@B2]-[@B4]\]. An inverse relationship exists between salivary fluoride concentration and caries experience in the deciduous and permanent dentition \[[@B5]\], but fluoride concentration is excluded from most caries prediction models \[[@B6],[@B7]\]. Acids in bacterial plaques cause caries in pits, fissures and interdental regions of teeth, but they also enhance the inhibitory effect of fluoride on demineralization, confounding the ability to predict caries from the salivary fluoride concentration \[[@B8],[@B9]\].

The greater the consumption of dietary sucrose, the greater the fall in pH and fraction of acidogenic, acid tolerant bacteria in tooth adherent plaques \[[@B10],[@B11]\]. The number of these bacteria (mostly mutans streptococci and lactobacilli), and the fluoride content, discriminate between severe and mild caries in 12--15 year-old children \[[@B12],[@B13]\]. Acid-tolerant bacteria require D-alanyl glycerol lipoteichoic acid (D-alanyl LTA) in their membranes and cell surfaces \[[@B14]\]. D-alanyl LTA is made by esterifying carboxyl-activated D-alanine to glycerol in membrane LTA by means of a D-alanyl-carrier enzyme, DCP \[[@B15]\]. Strains of *Streptococcus mutans* in which DCP is inactive do not initiate growth at below pH 6.5 and make glycerol LTA without D-alanine \[[@B14]\]. In the DCP active strains, soluble D-Alanyl LTA is extruded into culture fluid *in vitro*\[[@B16],[@B17]\] or plaque *in vivo*\[[@B18]\]. The D-alanyl esters are stable at pH 6.0 at 37Â°C, but hydrolyze to free D-alanine and LTA with a half-life of 3.9 h at pH 8.0 \[[@B19]\]. Healthy gingival sulci have a pH of 6.5 -- 7.5 and inflamed sulci a pH of 7.5--8.5 \[[@B20]\].

About 30% of young adults have serum IgG antibodies that precipitate with D-alanyl LTA, but not with D-alanine-free LTA \[[@B17],[@B21]\]. It is likely that plaques induce these IgG antibodies from gingival sulci that contain more acid-tolerant bacteria. An elevated IgG antibody response to D-alanyl LTA may therefore indicate the subjects in whom an inhibitory effect of fluoride on caries is enhanced. The fluoride concentrations of plaque and saliva are related to whether the drinking water is fluoridated \[[@B13]\] and to oral hygiene, which nearly always involves using a fluoridated dentrifice. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether elevated antibody responders to D-alanyl LTA show a association of DMFT with fluoride exposure and gingival health not apparent in low responders.
