{"text": "Download Book World War Z Movie Tie In Edition An Oral History Of The Zombie War in PDF format. You can Read Online World War Z Movie Tie In Edition An Oral History Of The Zombie War here in PDF, EPUB, Mobi or Docx formats.\nAn account of the decade-long conflict between humankind and hordes of the predatory undead is told from the perspective of dozens of survivors who describe in their own words the epic human battle for survival.\nThe subject of this book is Shakespeare\u2019s investigation of religious ideas and phenomena that, from the Church\u2019s perspective, range from traditional orthodox belief to radical unorthodoxy. The book is the first to suggest that Shakespeare accommodates both secular and religious readings by embedding them simultaneously within his plays.\nIn his virtuosic new book noted cultural critic Mark Seltzer shows how suspense, as art form and form of life, depicts and shapes the social systems that organize our modern world. Modernity's predicament, Seltzer writes, is a society so hungry for reality that it cannot stop describing itself, and that makes for a world that continuously establishes itself by staging its own conditions. Employing the social theories of Georg Simmel, Erving Goffman, Niklas Luhmann, and Peter Sloterdijk, Seltzer shows how suspense novels, films, and performance art by Patricia Highsmith, Tom McCarthy, Cormac McCarthy, J. G. Ballard, Karl Ove Knausgaard, and others outline how we currently live and reveal the stress-points and mood-systems of the modern epoch. In its focus on social games, depictions of violent and explosive persons, along with its cast of artists, reporters, detectives, and others who observe and report and reenact, the suspense mode creates and recreates modern systems of action and autonomy, and defines the self-turned world's practices and aesthetics. By epitomizing a reflexive, self-legislating, and autonomous world, a suspense art with humans in the systems epoch provides the models and sets the rules for our modern, official world.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T02:46:28Z", "url": "http://www.nwcbooks.com/download/world-war-z-movie-tie-in-edition-an-oral-history-of-the-zombie-war/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}

{"text": "It spreads like a wild fire. \u201cIt can never happen to me! I can\u2019t get infected; I am protected. I have taken all the precautions necessary not to get infected.\u201d No, we are not talking about a serious disease. We are talking about ransomware. A virus/malware that encrypts not only the data on your computer, but can reach out to any \u201cdrive\u201d on your network that you have access to and encrypts that information as well. This encryption holds the data \u201chostage\u201d with the sole purpose of extorting money from the victim by requesting payment in exchange for the decryption key that will restore their valuable data.\nChances are that you know of a person or business that has suffered a ransomware attack. The virus does not discriminate, an outbreak can occur in small or large businesses, local municipalities (even police departments), school districts and hospitals. In fact, in February 2016, a California hospital (Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center) was hit with ransomware, as a result their network was offline for over a week. That means no access to email, patient data and other critical documentation that affected the daily operations of the hospital. What would the impact be if ransomware hit your business and you had little or no access to critical information for over a week? The global spread and impact of ransomware further indicates this is a pandemic!\nThere are a number of ransomware threats that have become prevalent, including CryptoLocker or CryptoWall. These malwares have been linked to a number of different emails and/or links on websites. No matter how the infection took place, the result is the same, the malware gets downloaded to a PC and will scan all physical and network (logical) drives and encrypt certain file types. The virus can also attack USB thumb drives that are attached to the infected computer along with folders that are mapped to cloud storage solutions (e.g. Dropbox).\nFiles that get encrypted are typically popular data format files including: Microsoft Office, Adobe programs, iTunes or other music players and photo viewers. The files are compromised using a combination of two different encryption schemes; 256-bit AES and 2048-bit RSA. This basically renders the files useless without the decryption key; brute force or other tools cannot break the encryption on these files. When the ransomware has finished encrypting files on the PC, the virus will typically display a screen regarding a payment program that prompts the user to send a ransom payment to decrypt the files.\nA user is then given a limited amount of time to pay the ransom (typically 72 hours) or it will delete the encryption key, making the encrypted files permanently inaccessible. Typically, the ransom must be paid using Bitcoins; an untraceable payment system. Once a payment is made and verified, the victim will then receive the decryption key in order to decrypt the files held for ransom.\nOnce the ransomware virus has infiltrated a computer and a user takes notice, most of the damage has already been done. If a computer is infected with a ransomware virus, first disconnect the computer immediately from any wireless/wired networks. Although there are software tools that can remove the malware from a computer, once files have been encrypted, they cannot be decrypted without the decryption (private) key. Essentially, three options then exist; 1) pay the ransom, 2) restore any encrypted files from the most recent backup, or 3) assuming a good back-up does not exist, chalk this experience to a cyber-incident and format the hard drive to start from scratch (all too often even if the infected computer was \u201ccleaned\u201d from ransomware, remnants of the malware still exist and may cause problems later).\nThe key here is having a useable and viable backup. Many times as a result of a ransomware infection, businesses learn that their backup is not effectively working or not backing up all files. In either situation, the user may have to resort to option 1 or 3; pay the ransom or format their computer resulting in lost/not retrievable files.\nBackup, Backup and Backup \u2013 Having a usable and viable backup (not just a copy of files) can substantially mitigate risks and protect your data. Make sure backup is performed daily and that all files are part of this process. Full daily backups will help ensure a smoother process if there is a ransomware attack. Make sure the backup process through a restore is effectively working. Restore files from backup on a monthly or quarterly basis to provide peace of mind.\nDon\u2019t Open Emails From Strangers \u2013 One of the most common ways ransomware is transmitted is through email. Try to not open emails from people that you are not familiar with. DO NOT open attachments or click on links that are in non-familiar emails.\nMinimize Network Access \u2013 Perform an assessment to determine the level of access to information each user has on the network. As mentioned previously, ransomware can reach beyond the PC it originally encrypted to the files on the network, affecting the entire company. Limiting access to network files will help mitigate these risks.\nPatch, Patch and Patch \u2013 Patches to various software (operating systems, firewalls, application software) systems become available on a regular basis. Patches should be applied to the various software solutions your organization uses (weekly or monthly) in order to mitigate risks and give the attackers fewer options for infecting your system(s) with ransomware.\nTrain Employees \u2013 More often than not, ransomware infections are a result of an employee accessing an email, opening an attachment or clicking on a link from an unknown source. Train employees on what to look for and how to avoid infected emails and/or websites. This will help mitigate risks with not only ransomware but other types of cyber-related issues (e.g. phishing attacks).\nMaintain An Endpoint Solution \u2013 Many of the various virus/malware protection solutions (endpoints) for PCs will detect ransomware and eliminate the threat. Having up-to-date endpoint solutions (similar to patches) is important to ensure that variants of ransomware will be detected and removed. Having different virus/malware solutions on servers, firewalls and PCs can also strengthen the threat detection and removal process.\nWhile we cannot eliminate the threat of ransomware, we can significantly mitigate the risk of an attack, and reduce the potential consequences. Organizations can no longer believe \u201cit can\u2019t happen to me,\u201d because it can and most likely will. Start by understanding where your organization may have some areas of weakness and assessing where improvements can be made in systems, patches, employee training and most importantly in your backup solution.", "meta": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T18:51:33Z", "url": "https://www.blumshapiro.com/insights/ransomware-cybersecurity-services-malware-ct-ma-ri/", "language": "en", "source": "c4"}}
