{"text":"It is possible to love someone who does not love you back. the challenge is how to stop yourself from loving them. Find out how to overcome this challenge.\nIt is a tough step to take but it is the right thing to do. You need to come to terms with the fact that someone you are in love with does not love you anymore. You try to figure out how someone could stop loving you and leave you. You might find yourself going back to the memories you made together and hating them. You will also hate all the songs you both loved. You might even start hating the joint you both loved going to. The important thing you need to do is to take that step and accept that someone does not love you. There is no need to hate a song you once loved because of someone. Accept that their feelings have changed and this will help you to move on and be true to yourself.\nYou need to sit back and ask yourself why you need to be with someone who does not love you. Think and see if the relationship is any different now that he or she does not love you. You should ask yourself if you really need such a person in your life. Such questions will help you to know why it is so hard for you to let him or her go. You should stop using so much energy trying to make someone fall in love with you. Just find a way to make yourself happy and this will help you to heal. Put yourself first and think about what you need as an individual. This will help you to start letting go and start the healing process.\nWhen you become a couple with someone, you stop thinking as an individual and start thinking as a couple. You might find that along the way you started relying on the other person. This can be very hard to stop especially when you go through a breakup. It is time for you to take a step and start being your own person. You need to realize that before you became a couple with someone, you were once on your own. There were things you did on your own before you fell in love. You should not let someone prevent you from becoming the wonderful person you were before you met him or her. You should start making your own decisions and not rely on someone else for that.\nThe heartbreak may hurt you to an extent where you start blaming yourself. You become so hurt that you believe you did something wrong. This is so wrong and you need to avoid blaming yourself. You are not responsible for how someone else feels. Playing the blaming game will only prevent you from healing. You need to realize that if you hate yourself then you do not have respect for yourself. You need to wake up and start valuing yourself because no one will do that for you. Someone should not prevent you from loving yourself. Never forget that no one is more important in your life than you are.\nLetting go of lost love is a very difficult but important step. When you do this, you need to take a step back from relationships and get to know yourself better. You need to be at peace with yourself and forget the past. You need to take time to grieve for the love you lost. You can try out new things that will help you forget and move on. Start listening to new songs that may help you with the healing process. You can have an adventure by traveling to new places that will make you heal from all the hurt you went through. Start focusing on the future and on yourself. This will help you to re-invent yourself and in the end, you will have peace.\nYou need to realize that when someone falls out of love, there is no way he or she can fall in love with you again. You have to stop hoping that he or she will start loving you again. If you have this mentality, you will not move on. You will still be in love with the person and this will only hurt you in the end. You need to accept that it is over and that there is more to life than having false hope. Having false hope will make you do crazy things like frequently calling or visiting the person. This will make you seem like you are so desperate which is so wrong. The only hope you should be having is that you might find love again with someone who adores you.\nGoing through a heartbreak can really take a toll on you. You need to be strong no matter how hurt you are. You need to realize that life has thrown so much your way and you have always been able to overcome everything. You need to be strong and not let someone define your life and how you feel. You might be surprised to find that he or she is also heartbroken after the split. Remember that there is strength in you and that you can move on from this. Put a brave face and move on knowing that nothing can pull you down.\nWhen someone breaks your heart, you might feel like this is the end of the world. You might feel that nothing will ever matter in your life again. You need to remove that notion from your mind and always remember that you are beautiful and amazing. Remember who you were before you fell in love. You should be a free spirit again and starting loving everything in your life. Embrace your newfound freedom and your independence. You need to love life again and most especially love yourself. When you do all this, you are bound to get something good in your life. You need to be happy and not mopping because someone stopped loving you. Your life should not revolve around a single person. Love life and remember that your true love is yet to come your way.\nAfter heartbreak, you will feel like you need to get rid of certain things in your life. You feel like you want to have a new start. This is good since you have learned that you need to move on. It is natural to want to start afresh. You can do this by getting yourself a brand new look. You can go and do some new shopping or even change your current hairstyle. Go out with friends or even attend karaoke and sing a song or two. Getting a new look does not mean you are becoming a different person. This will help you to have a new perspective on life. You are the same person only that you are stronger than you were during the heartbreak. This will show you that you are mature and can face anything life throws at you. You never know, you might even look better than you did before.\nThis step should not be taken immediately after finding out that someone is no longer in love with you. If you start dating someone else, he or she will only be a rebound to you. It is not fair to treat someone as a rebound as he or she could really be in love with you. When you do this, you will not give yourself time to heal and move on. If you are over the relationship and you have moved on, then try dating again. Go out and toss yourself into the dating world. Having a wonderful date will help you to become more confident. Putting yourself out there will make you feel alive again especially when you start socializing again. You will start having fun again and you never know you might find yourself meeting someone who fancies you. Falling in love always gives you a wonderful feeling. The most amazing thing is to fall in love with someone who loves and adores you. The worst thing is to realize that he or she has stopped loving you. It can be so devastating and you might feel like your world has ended. The most important thing for you to do is to get out of that relationship. The 10 steps discussed above will help you to stop loving someone who does not love you. When you find yourself moving on, know that it is a wonderful thing and you are ready to love again. You never know your true love could still be out there waiting for you.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T06:32:35Z\",\"url\":\"https://pandagossips.com/posts/1812\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"It’s Day 11, and I’m joined by another of my brilliant Brit Babe friends today, the awesome Victoria Blisse. I believe she has secrets to share!\nSecrets, we all have them, we all keep them for other people. I think it’s why fiction revolving around them prove so popular. We all know that it could all back fire, one slip of the tongue and that secret could be the talk of the town.\n“You still have that?” Ryan asked, eyes widening, mouth softening into a smile. His hand was still over mine, heating my fingers to boiling point.\nHe scrunched his eyebrows in confusion.\nI swallowed hard—a lump had formed in my throat. My skin felt electrified and there was a waterfall of tears pressing at the backs of my eyes.\nHis strong, soft hand cupped my cheek, and as a tear slipped down he gently wiped it away with his thumb.\n“I still think you’re the best girl in the world,” he whispered, his breath caressing my lips he was so very close.\n“And you’re not bad, for a boy,” I replied with a wry smile, remembering back to the first argument we’d ever had. Ryan hadn’t wanted to play pretend mummies and daddies with me even though I’d told him he could be a builder for his job and I’d let him play with my Lego. I’d run off crying and he’d followed me and told me he was sorry and that he thought I was the best girl in the world.\nWe’d laughed then, like six-year-olds do, and had got back to playing.\nI snapped back to the present, his lips so close to mine, his hand on my cheek. I felt as though I was shaking, my whole body taken by a quake of shock and lust. His lips met mine and I stilled. Quiet peace reigned for a moment. I was at the pinnacle of bliss, everything was perfect and light. Then he moved his lips and the agitation returned. I burned deep in the pit of my stomach, my skin itched for his touch and I burned up, waiting for more.\nHe was my first kiss. I didn’t know what I was doing but instinct pushed me forward. I reached out to grab at his biceps, needing to feel more of him—he kept me grounded. I’d fall away into a chasm of darkness if I let go. I wanted to know it was real. Could I get him to pinch me to make sure I wasn’t dreaming?\nMany thanks Victoria! Fantastic extract.\nJust three more archive dipping days left folks.

{"text":"Iryna Sysoenko, People’s Deputy of Ukraine, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee on Health Care, explains the political election processes, victories of Ukraine in 2018, gender equality, exclusively for the Fashion of Diplomacy.\nDear Iryna, we are talking to you at the beginning of the New Year – both calendar and political. Therefore, it would be advisable to ask about the political New Year, which promises to be rich in significant events for our country, as you see it. What will it bring to the Ukrainians in your opinion?\n– The next year will be the year of double elections: presidential and parliamentary. Of course, I want to believe that 2019 will be the year of real change. But we already see a series of dirty political manipulations, false slogans and promises used by politicians in the struggle for positions and armchairs. However I hope that Ukrainians will prudently approach the main political events this year, before the elections. It is said that every nation chooses the authorities it deserves. So, I think that Ukrainians deserve an honest government that will work efficiently, and not simulate, which, with its clear steps and actions, will improve the standard of citizens’ living, the level of education, medicine, and will bring our country to a new economic level, and finally, to the level of developed European countries. When deciding who to cast a vote, it is important to evaluate not the promises that many times had sounded from the mouths of those who held the reins of power, but to evaluate the things done.\nThe past political year was not easy as well. What would you name the main Ukrainian victory of 2018?\n– Yes, indeed, the last year was not easy, but very important. Since I am in the parliament dealing with medicine, I would like to talk about the main positive points in the medical field.\nThis is primarily due to the fact that in 2018 the first changes in the financing of the health system began, the first steps to implement new laws, which were adopted by the parliament.\n2018 became the year when the state began to pay for medical services to family physicians, pediatricians, and therapists through the state budget funds. Medical institutions began to be reorganized into non-profit enterprises, which will allow them to receive much more money from the state, insurance companies, employers, and any sources of financing. Nowadays, the patients have not felt changes yet, because it needs time. But in the coming years, the state will pay for diagnostic services in the hospitals, from 2020 for operations, appeals to surgeons, urologists, cardiologists, narrow specialists.\nWith the new laws we have foreseen, and the government has to do it, that patients have to spend less and less money when they go to the hospital. In the end, the norm of the Constitution of Ukraine on free medical care should work in reality when it is free of charge for patients, but paid for the state.\nHow and when did your political career begin? What made you go for politics?\n– Being an attorney by education, I understood that all processes are carried out according to certain rules, which are established by law. That is why, I have set myself the goal to be where the laws are written and adopted – the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This was precisely the motivation that was the main impetus for me to go for politics. Helping one, two people is good, but I want to change the system to help many people. And without new laws, the health care system will never change.\nThere is a lot of talking that Ukrainian women are not sufficiently represented in politics. Do you agree with such a point of view? Do not you think that your political career refutes such allegations?\n– Not only I am a successful example of a woman-politician in our country. I want to say that in Ukraine, more and more women are holding high positions in various fields of government.\nwomen who are the heads of villages, women governors, heads of regional councils. Therefore, we cannot say that we are lagging behind the world in the issue of women’s presence in Ukrainian politics. And this brings hope that Ukraine will develop precisely thanks to women.\nHow difficult is it to be a womanpolitician in Ukraine? What is the main obstacle, and what is the main advantage in the activity of a womanpolitician?\nthe ability to take responsibility. It is a natural quality; it is connected with the process of delivery of a child and further responsibility for him/her.\nFor example, the widespread assertion that politics is not a women’s profession. All around try to obtrude on a woman-politician an opinion that politics is a hard day-to-day job, daily stress, it is communication skills, the ability to take the heat and stick to their position. There are attempts to devalue women-politicians, to persuade that as a woman, she acts emotionally, not intellectually, and so on. That is, there will always be people who resist the change of paradigm, but their views are becoming obsolete in the first place. I am sure that when you are praised by colleagues in politics, you do not exist. An excuse to drink champagne is when you begin to be criticized by your colleagues, rejoice when it starts to happen.\nAnother stereotype: “A woman-politician is a bad wife and mother”. There is a widespread perception that a woman working in politics cannot be a good wife or mother, since she leaves her strength at work. This is a stereotype with which it is necessary to work hard. After all, the position of the leader is not only new rights and opportunities in the world of men, but also responsibilities that do not exclude the duties given to us by nature: being a mother and a wife.\nIn my opinion, it is necessary to educate children by our own example. So, you will never teach a child to love work if you do not work yourself. Children do not always hear us, but they perceive very well our behavior, what we do and how we do it. From my own experience, the more you have achieved, the better the future you form for your children.\nIt is also said: “A woman-politician is doing work all the time, so she’s strong, but lonely.” 4 years being in parliament, I work a lot, but last year I got married a second time. In addition to me, three other women-deputies also added the status of the wife to their status, the same applies to pregnancy and giving birth to a child.\nThat is, in the modern world, a woman can also build a political career, and marry and give birth to children!\n“A woman who goes to politics ceases to belong to herself” and this is the biggest mistake.\nThat is, your day begins with a lot of calls, a large number of simultaneous tasks, a high level of stress, you do not sleep and at a certain stage negative physiological processes begin! This is the limit you must not reach. The issue of your own health should always be in the first place.\nIn politics there will always be people who will quickly replace you, but you will never replace your health and appearance. I see how my female colleagues work from morning till night, how they cease to pay attention to their body, they are getting overweight, their hormonal background changes, health problems begin, then men start to behave differently, in the end you do not want your husband to live with you just because you have a deputy’s badge.\nRecently, the women’s forum “I’m happy”, initiated by you, has taken place. What is the purpose of the forum, how is it different from other forums?\nWhen I planned to hold a women’s forum, first of all, the goal was to make it useful for women. I wanted to raise the issue not only about women’s success in politics or women in business, or the issue of gender equality, which is now very fashionable.\nThis is all very important, but it is only a component of that large and many-sided female happiness! That’s exactly what I wanted to talk to women about.\nAfter all, every person wants to be happy, but for everyone in a certain period of life, happiness will mean something different.\nAnd it is important for every woman to understand what her happiness is, what she really wants. And I am very pleased that many women approached me, thanked and asked when the next event would take place. Therefore, it was just a good start, I plan to continue a series of similar events, because I felt they were useful.\nAs Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Parliament Committee on Health Care, what you can say about medical reform. How fair, in your opinion, is its critique, which we encounter in the media and social networks?\n– The Parliament has adopted the necessary qualitative medical laws, as I have already noted. But whether it will be good for people depends on how the Government will implement realize these laws. Personally, I will do my best and all that depends on me, so that people feel protected, crossing the threshold of the hospital.\nWhat would you like to wish the readers of our edition?\n– Despite the continuous distrust of the society to the authorities, the parliament; the disappointment in everything that is happening in our country, I want to wish to keep good and love to Ukraine, to relatives and friends in heart.\nMuch depends on each of us and only we can build a strong, successful country, nobody, except us, will do it. Successful and happy Ukraine begins with a happy Ukrainian, happy family.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-22T18:14:48Z\",\"url\":\"https://fashion-diplomacy.com/en/news/politics/the-political-election-processes-victories-of-ukraine-in-2018-gender-equality/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"On the afternoon of February 20, 1943, Dionisio Pulido, a farmer in the Mexican state of Michoacán, was readying his fields for spring sowing when the ground nearby opened in a fissure about 150 fee long. \"I then felt a thunder,\" he recalled later, \"the trees trembled, and is was then I saw how, in the hole, the ground swelled and raised it self 2 or 21/2 meters high, and a kind of smoke or fine dust–gray, like ashes–began to rise, with a hiss or whistle, loud and continuous; and there was a smell of sulphur. I then became greatly frightened and tried to help unyoke one of the ox teams.\"\nVirtually under the farmer's feet, a volcano was being born. Pulido and the handful of other witnesses fled. By the next morning, when he returned, the cone had grown to a height of 30 feet and was \"hurling out rocks with great violence.\" During the day, the come grew another 120 feet. That night, incandescent bombs blew more than 1,000 feet up into the darkness, and a slaglike mass of lava rolled over Pulido's cornfields.\nThe scientific world was almost as stunned as the hapless farmer himself by the volcano's sudden appearance. Around the world, volcanic eruptions are commonplace, but the birth of an entirely new volcano, marked by the arrival at the earth's surface of a distinct vent from the magma chamber, is genuinely rare. In North America, only two new volcanoes have appeared in historic times. One of them was western Mexico's Jorullo, born in 1759 some 50 miles southeast of Dionisio Pulido's property. The second, born about 183 years later in Pulido's field, was named Paricutín for a nearby village that it eventually destroyed.\nParicutín and Jorullo both rose in an area known for its volcanoes. Called the Mexican Volcanic Belt, the region stretches about 700 miles from east to west across southern Mexico. Geologists say that eruptive activity deposited a layer of volcanic rock some 6,000 feet thick, creating a high and fertile plateau. During summer months, the heights snag moisture-laden breezes from the Pacific Ocean; rich farmland, in turn, has made this belt the most populous region in Mexico.\nThough the region already boasted three of the country's four largest cities–Mexico City, Puebla, and Guadalajara–the area around Paricutín, some 200 miles west of the capital, was still a peaceful backwater inhabited by Tarascan Indians in the early 1940s. Its gently rolling landscape, in a zone that had experienced almost no volcanic activity during historic times, was one of Mexico's loveliest. Although hundreds of extinct cinder cones rose around the small valleys, the only eruption in human memory had been that of distant Jorullo.\nThe Tarascan had no folk legends concerning volcanic eruptions in the area. But when Paricutín came into their lives, they saw events, in retrospect, that foretold the cataclysm. The first event was a sacrilege: the 1941 destruction of a large wooden cross on a hillside. The second one hinted at biblical retribution: a plague of locusts in 1942. When 1943 began, so did the third sign: a series of earthquakes; these were preceded, said one man, by \"many noises in the center of the earth.\"\nOn February 19, the day before the volcano began to erupt, some 300 earthquakes shook the ground. On February 22, with the new cone rising and fiery skyrockets descending, the first of many geologists who would monitor and map Paricutín's behaviour over the next nine years arrived. From then on, Paricutín was under constant observation: It yielded a trove of information, including unique, fleeting glimpses of ephemeral features.\nNew volcanic phenomena and processes were sometimes obliterated almost as soon as they were recorded, especially during Paricutín's first year of violent, explosive growth and change. In that year, the cone topped 1,100 feet, four-fifths of its final height; explosions echoed all over the state of Michoacan; ash snowed on faraway Mexico City; and almost all of the vegetation for miles around the crater was destroyed.\nDuring the summer of 1943, probably the volcano's most violent period. Lava rose to about 50 feet below the crater's rim. That fall, a new vent opened explosively at the cone's base, fountaining lava high into the sky. Lava finally destroyed the nearby villages the following year, but most villagers has seen their livelihoods disappear long before that.\nOver the next years, lava flows continued with little interruption. But in February of 1952, almost exactly nine years after Paricutín was born, the volcano experienced its last major spasm of activity. By then, villages and farms had been relocated with government assistance. The new Bracero Program drew many of the displaced farmers to California for seasonal agricultural work.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T23:49:54Z\",\"url\":\"http://wonderclub.com/WorldWonders/ParicutinHistory.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

Any award may be confirmed and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. All post-award proceedings will be governed by the FAA.\nThe fees payable to JAMS shall be borne equally by the parties, provided that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other party for reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration.\nAll notices of copyright infringement claims should be sent to the copyright agent designated in our Copyright Policy DMCA Section in the manner and by the means set forth therein.\nAll other feedback, comments, requests for technical support and other communications relating to the Website should be submitted using our contact form.\nNo waiver by the Website of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Website to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Service, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.

{"text":"After a jury convicted her of “fraudulent scheme and artifice” and the trial judge put her on “a four-year term of probation, which included . . . thirty days in jail”, Kristella Brandenburg appealed. State v. Brandenburg, 2013 WL 396163 (Arizona Court of Appeals 2013). On appeal, she argued that “insufficient evidence supported her conviction.” State v. Brandenburg, supra.\nto determine whether the evidence in the record is strong enough to support the judgment. If the trial court's judgment was in favor of the plaintiff (the person suing), the appellate court looks at whether the evidence, if believed, would convince the average person that the plaintiff proved his/her case by a preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, the reviewing court does not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility (believability) of witnesses. Instead, the appellate court accepts the trial court's fact finding and affirms the judgment unless the appellate standard is not met.\nThis explanation addresses appellate review of a judgment in a civil case, but the basic principles are the same. The most important differences are that the appellate court is reviewing the conviction (rather than a civil judgment) and, in so doing, is deciding whether the evidence, as accepted by the jury, would convince the average person that the defendant’s guilty had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAny person who, pursuant to a scheme or artifice to defraud, knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, promises or material omissions is guilty of a class 2 felony.\n`[A] “scheme or artifice” is some “plan, device, or trick” to perpetrate a fraud.’ State v. Haas, 138 Ariz. 413, 675 P.2d 673 (Arizona Supreme Court 1983), quoting State v. Stewart, 118 Ariz. 281, 576 P.2d 140 (Arizona Court of Appeals 1978). Reliance by the victim or any other person is not an element of the offense. . . . Thus, `[s]omething is fraudulent when it is “reasonably calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.”’ State v. Haas, supra (quoting U.S. v. Netterville, 553 F.2d 903 (U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit 1977)).\nBrandenburg, who was the victim's neighbor, occasionally helped the elderly victim and his wife with household tasks and had taken the victim's wife `to a few doctors' appointments.’ In May 2011, Brandenburg told the victim, his wife, and their professional caregiver that the victim had a doctor's appointment and that she would transport him to that appointment. She instead took him to an electronics store.\nOnce inside, she asked the victim if he wanted some water, and he apparently said that he did. While he sat near the registers, she went to buy the bottle of water and also obtained three laptop computers. Using the victim's credit card, she had the store clerk ring up the charges -- totaling $2,129.59 -- and brought the victim over to sign the digital pad.\nBrandenburg then walked the victim back to the car and settled him into the front passenger seat. She then retrieved the computers from the store and placed them in the back seat. She took the victim home, took him inside, and then took the computers from the car and walked home with them.\n[t]he following day, a representative of the electronics store called the victim and his wife to confirm the computer purchases. They were `stunned’ and `shocked’ to discover Brandenburg had used their credit card to purchase the computers; they cancelled the credit card and reported the incident to police.\ncontention that the supreme court in Haas intended to impose a limitation on the scope of the statute. It stated that a scheme and artifice to defraud `is not defined according to any technical standard.’ State v. Haas, supra. It also stated the statute generally proscribes conduct `lacking in “fundamental honesty [and] fair play . . . in the general and business life of members of society.”’ State v. Haas, supra, quoting Blachly v. U.S., 380 F.2d 665, 671 (U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit1967).\nThe term `defraud’ as used in the statute is broadly construed `to cover all of the varieties made possible by boundless human ingenuity.’ State v. Haas, supra. The supreme court and the legislature clearly intended that the acts charged here, if proven, would constitute a crime.\ncorrect that it was uncontradicted, the jury nonetheless was free to reject her testimony that the signature pad showed the total amount of the purchase and therefore could infer the victim was not aware of the value of the purchases he had signed for. See State v. Lowery, 230 Ariz. 536, 287 P.3d 830 (Arizona Court of Appeals 2012) (jury free to discredit defendant's testimony); see also State v. Clemons, 110 Ariz. 555, 521 P.2d 987 (Arizona Supreme Court 1974) (`No rule is better established than that the credibility of the witnesses and the weight and value to be given to their testimony are questions exclusively for the jury.’).\nSimilarly, the jury could reject Brandenburg's testimony the computers were within the victim's view when he signed the signature pad. In any event, the jury fairly could conclude that the victim, having been informed only that he was purchasing a bottle of water, would not have reason to believe he was buying three computers merely because they were sitting nearby.\n[a]s we noted above, Brandenburg claimed the victim had agreed to purchase a computer for her. But, even if the jury found Brandenburg's description of events credible, it could find Brandenburg guilty of violating Arizona Revised Statutes § 13-2310(A).\nThe jury did not have to conclude that the victim would know the price of $2,129.59 purportedly shown on the signature pad was for multiple computers instead of only one or that the presence of three boxes near the register meant that person would know he was purchasing three computers instead of one computer and accessories or other related items.\nEven if we agreed Brandenburg's statements suggest, as a whole, she merely had convinced the victim to purchase three computers for her, it did not require the jury to reach that conclusion. Instead, her statements clearly permitted the jury to infer she had obtained the victim's signature for the purchase of three computers despite his belief he was purchasing only one.\nto the extent Brandenburg asserts the facts of this case are analogous to State v. Johnson, 179 Ariz. 375, 880 P.2d 132 (Arizona Supreme Court 1994), we disagree. In Johnson, the defendant used a gas card given to him by his employer to purchase gasoline for personal use. . . . Our supreme court determined there was no fraud present because the employee had not used pretense in obtaining the card or in purchasing the gasoline; he merely had purchased more than he was authorized. . . .\nHere, in contrast, the jury could find Brandenburg induced the victim to purchase the computers by misrepresenting what he was purchasing.\nThe Court of Appeals therefore affirmed Brandenburg’s conviction and sentence. State v. Brandenburg, supra.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T18:45:44Z\",\"url\":\"http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-helpful-neighbor-electronics-store.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"More layers = more fun.\nFormal dressing in the winter is super annoying. In lieu of a simple dress and heels, you&apos;ve got a number of layers to consider -- and frankly, you&apos;d rather be wearing sweatpants. To help, we&apos;ve put together three standout -- and practical -- looks for your next winter wedding. Pro tip: Do your best to steer clear of sleet and snow by quickly jumping into cars or wear boots that you can change out of when you arrive to the venue. And finally, never underestimate the power of alcohol to make unbearable weather and long ceremonies much more tolerable.\nA black dress is always a good idea, and this one has a velvet lining on the neck and arms that makes it perfect for winter events. A structured coat adds another layer of elegance, and its baby pink color is an easy way to bright up the black dress and heels (and presumably, tights). Finish it off with sparkly accessories and pearl earrings for an easy wedding outfit win.\n1. Issa Sophie Compact-Jersey Dress, $425, available at Matches Fashion; 2. Cedric Charlier Light Pink Long Coat, $1,790, available at Avenue 32; 3. Sutra Crystal Minaudière, $498, available at DVF; 4. Pearl 360 Studs, $28, available at Baublebar; 5. Lissie Heels, $350, available at Kate Spade.\nA long dress is an easy way to stay warm (even if you don&apos;t decide to wear tights underneath) and this pleated style from Topshop is a glamorous statement for an evening wedding. I realize this fur jacket&apos;s is outrageously expensive, but it&apos;s so beautiful and really any cropped fuzzy topper would be the perfect complement for the dress. Opt for vintage-inspired black and gold accessories for a polished touch.\n1. Strappy Pleated Maxi Dress, $105, available at Topshop; 2. Balmain Fur Biker Jacket, $12,546, available at Mytheresa; 3. Ted Baker Cierra Round Tassel Zip Clutch Bag, $244.46, available at Asos; 4. Charlotte Olympia Debbie Patent-Leather Pumps, $845, available at Net-a-Porter; 5. Serefina Chain Lariat Necklace, $75, available at Shopbop.\nIf the men can be warm in their suits, why can&apos;t we? This black and navy style is a fresh take on wedding dressing. You can wear any simple black blouse or shirt underneath and accessorize with a touch of bling on the wrist and festooned ankle boots. Finish it off with a light grey cocoon coat and you&apos;ll be reception ready, come rain or snow.\n1. Two-Tone Tuxedo Jacket, $248, available at J.Crew; 2. Valentino Rockstud Ankle Booties, $1,375, available at Barneys New York; 3. Two-Tone Tuxedo Pant, $148, available at J.Crew; 4. Masculine Wool Coat, $104 (on sale), available at Zara; 5. Claire V. Haircalf Flat Clutch, $198, available at Shopbop; 6. Two-Tone Gold Bracelet, $1,495, available at The Real Real.\nIt's like a vest, but cooler — and warmer.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-19T10:53:03Z\",\"url\":\"https://fashionista.com/2014/11/winter-wedding\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Second-round play on the women’s side continues on the red clay of Roland Garros in Paris for the 2016 French Open on Wednesday, highlighted by matches involving No. 6 Simona Halep, a legitimate contender here, and No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska. Both are favored in the online betting odds to advance.\nHalep, who opened this tournament as the third betting favorite, moved on with an easy 6-2, 6-0 victory against Nao Hibino. Three of Halep’s last four Grand Slam appearances have ended with defeat to players ranked outside the Top 50, but there was never any danger of world No. 70 Hibino extending this sequence. Two years ago, on the back of a terrific clay court season Halep made it all the way to the final at Roland Garros. Despite a recent triumph in Madrid, this time around she arrived in the French capital with less fanfare, yet a favorable draw has opened up the possibility of another deep run. Halep, 25, is aiming to go one step further this year in Paris after being runner-up in 2014. She seems to have found her form since winning the Madrid Masters and is probably the biggest threat to Serena Williams in her current state. Halep is a -1400 favorite on betting odds against Zarina Diyas, who is ranked No. 90 in the world. She beat Carina Witthoeft in three sets in Round 1. Diyas won 61 percent of her first serve points and 30 percent of her second serve points. She has two career wins over Top-10 players. Diyas has won five singles titles on the ITF tour. In January 2015, she reached her best singles ranking of world No. 31. Diyas is primarily an aggressive baseliner whose game is centered around powerful and accurate groundstrokes. Her forehand, which generates a considerable amount of pace, is often used to move her opponents around the court and out of position, which therefore allows her to dominate and win points from or around the back of the court. These two have faced twice in the past, and Help won both in straight sets. The two matches took place in the 2014 Wimbledon and 2014 Australian Open. Diyas has won just eight games against Halep in both matches.\nMeanwhile, No. 2 Radwanska advanced with a 6-0, 6-2 rout of Bojana Jovanovski. Radwanska hadn’t played a match since losing in the first round of the Madrid Open to Dominika Cibulkova, but it was an even longer lay-off for Jovanovski, who had been off the tour since St. Petersburg in February. As the Serb struggled to find her range, Radwanska soared, hitting 22 winners to just nine unforced errors, breaking serve five times and saving all three break points. Radwanska, from Poland, won the WTA Tour finals last year and reached the Australian Open semifinals this season but has had mixed clay-court results in 2016 and her best result in Paris to date was reaching the quarterfinals in 2013. She will face Carolina Garcia. She advanced with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Lesia Tsurenko. With the crowd behind the young Frenchwoman, Garcia swept the final five games to win her fifth match in a row following her title run at the Internationaux de Strasbourg last week. Radwanska is a -185 favorite. My Expert Predictions Take both favorites in online betting, although I do give Garcia a legitimate shot at the upset and do expect that to go three sets.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T23:13:48Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/tennis/french-open-womens-top-picks/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"Andrew R over a year ago. And this happened for a while so I saw my doctor although I never mentioned the masterbating coause it's quite an embarrasing subject to talk to a doctor about.

{"text":"For the first time since the old Catholics vs. Convicts matchup, a Notre Dame-Miami game has huge national relevance this Saturday. The No. 3 Irish are slight road favorites at the No. 7 Hurricanes, with the winner being very much alive to reach the College Football Playoff. So you might be thinking that the College Football lines are going to be pretty tight and they are. The NCAAF odds currently have Notre Dame winning by a field goal, but it seems that Miami can overcome those odds.\nThe last time Miami lost a game was Oct. 29 last year in South Bend, 30-27. Justin Yoon kicked a 23-yard field goal with 30 seconds left. Notre Dame outgained Miami 143-2 in total yards in jumping to a 17-0 lead in the first quarter and extended the lead to 20-0 early in the second quarter. But special teams turned it around for Miami. Both starting QBs that day, the Hurricanes’ Brad Kaaya and Irish’s DeShone Kizer, are now in the NFL. ESPN GameDay will be on hand this Saturday. This will mark the 7th straight time Notre Dame has been on the road in a GameDay site. The last time ESPN came to Notre Dame’s campus was back in 2012 for the Stanford game. Notre Dame is 8-11 all-time on the road when they are playing at a GameDay site. Brian Kelly sports a record of 4-5 in GameDay appearances.\nThe Irish are going to reach the playoff if they win out but won’t if they lose here. They come off a 48-37 win over Wake Forest. The Irish (8-1) racked up 710 total yards, coming within 10 yards of the previous school single-game record of 720 set against Navy on Nov. 1, 1969. It was a balanced attack, with 380 rushing yards to go with 330 yards through the air. Quarterback Brandon Wimbush was responsible for 390 total yards, leading Irish rushers with 110 yards (two touchdowns) and passing for another 280 (one touchdown). Wimbush’s two rushing touchdowns brought his season total to 13 — extending his school record — and his career total to 14 — tying for seventh all-time with Joe Montana and Everett Golson. Wide receiver Chase Claypool hauled in a career-high 180 yards with one touchdown to lead all receivers. Star RB Josh Adams left early vs. Wake Forest because he “wasn’t feeling right,” as Kelly said after the game. Adams carried the ball just five times for 22 yards. Meanwhile, Wimbush suffered a bruise on his non-throwing hand and played a portion of the game with a protective wrap on it. Both will be good to go vs. Miami. The one question mark for the Irish moving forward appears to be senior wide receiver Cam Smith. Smith has missed the team’s past three games with a hamstring injury.\nThe Canes likely earned a spot in the ACC title game for the first time with last Saturday’s 28-10 home win over ranked Virginia Tech. Miami’s defense held Virginia Tech to 149 yards of total offense in the opening half, and allowed just 299 total yards over the course of the game. The Hokies were 3-of-14 on third down and averaged just 4.0 yards per play, while turning the ball over four times. Canes QB Malik Rosier finished the game 10-for-21 for 193 yards and accounted for three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) with three interceptions. He has thrown at least one touchdown pass in each of his nine career starts. Rosier’s 84 rushing yards on 13 carries were a career high. With the victory, the Hurricanes have the inside track to the ACC Coastal Division title. Miami has won eight consecutive games at Hard Rock Stadium and improved its FBS-leading win streak to 13 games. The win was costly though as redshirt junior defensive end Demetrius Jackson sustained a right-knee injury and had surgery Monday. A UM spokesman called it a “right lower extremity injury’’ and said that Jackson’s “status for the remainder of the 2017 season will be determined after the surgery.” Miami ranks first nationally in tackles for loss (8.8 per game), fifth in team sacks (3.5) and third in team passing efficiency defense (98.33). The Hurricanes trail the all-time series with Notre Dame 18-7-1, but Miami has won five straight matchups against the Fighting Irish in Miami. The Irish have not won in Miami since 1977. Miami has lost four straight games overall to Notre Dame – including a 27-30 loss on Oct. 29, 2016.\nNotre Dame wins to keep its playoff hopes alive – that wouldn’t hurt Miami’s ACC title chances. So take the Irish as part of your College Football lines for Week 11.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T15:23:21Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/ncaaf/notre-dame-vs-miami-lines-week-11-betting-analysis/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"While group games can be fun, sometimes an activity like a getting-to-know-you worksheet is a better way to break the ice at parties.\nPeople are very used to filling out forms about themselves.\nShy people can write down truths about themselves without having to say them out loud.\nPeople can read about each other and keep their reactions hidden.\nIt's easier to get everyone in a common frame of reference by asking them the same questions.\nYou can send the worksheet to them beforehand, in the invitation.\nPeople can control who gets to see their worksheet, which makes them feel safer.\nThe worksheets can be anonymous, at first, encouraging people to be honest.\nThe questions can be as silly, personal, or unusual as the host likes, which can spark conversations.\nThe getting-to-know-you worksheet can be themed to the event (Halloween, Superbowl, etc).\nFor the more technologically savvy, the worksheets could be filled out online like surveys at sites such as [www.my3q.com My3q.com].\nOf course, there is also one very large problem with a getting-to-know-you worksheet, whether using it in a big group or just as a couple - it means a great deal of time is spent head down, filling out the form. That's time when you are not interacting with the other people, which is the best way to get to know anyone.\nDo Hedgehogs Make Good Pets?\nThere's also the problem of language, which is twofold: the questions and the answers.\nThe questions may be perfectly clear to the person who created the worksheet, but may not be to the people reading it. The same goes for questions such as \"What's your favorite football team?\" If the person isn't a fan, it's going to alienate them.\nThe answers may be in the people's heads, but not easily expressed. Not everyone is as facile with words and may have some difficulty expressing what they really mean.\nOne of the other problems with worksheets is that they are often simple, one-word answers - which any dating expert will tell you is not the way to build communication. Leading questions are better, and questions that lead to more questions going back and forth (also known as the art of conversation) are best of all.\nThere are many ways to get around the problems listed above. One way that works very well for couples-based groups is to have two circles, an inner circle and an outer one. Everyone asks one question of each other across the circle, and then the inner circle moves one person to the left. The next question is asked and answered. This leads to people talking to each other, but never with the pressure of having to ask or answer more than one question. More interestingly, the worksheets end up getting filled with composites of everyone's likes, dislikes, answers, and more - so you can learn a lot about the other people in the group without ever feeling put in the spotlight.\nMost of the sources of worksheets online are designed for schools, but are easily adapted to any occasion. You can find lists of questions for first dates, or just about relationships in general right here on LoveToKnow.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T05:27:51Z\",\"url\":\"https://dating.lovetoknow.com/Getting_to_Know_You_Worksheet\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Since the beginning, Sensory has been a pioneer in advancing AI technologies for consumer electronics. Not only did Sensory implement the first commercially successful speech recognition chip, but we also were first to bring biometrics to low cost chips, and speech recognition to Bluetooth devices. Perhaps what I am most proud of though, more than a decade ago Sensory introduced its TrulyHandsfree technology and showed the world that wakeup words could really work in real devices, getting around the false accept and false reject, and power consumption issues that had plagued the industry. No longer did speech recognition devices require button presses…and it caught on quickly!\nLet me go on boasting because I think Sensory has a few more claims to fame… Do you think Apple developed the first “Hey Siri” wake word? Did Google develop the first “OK Google” wake word? What about “Hey Cortana”? I believe Sensory developed these initial wake words, some as demos and some shipped in real products (like the Motorola MotoX smartphone and certain glasses). Even third-party Alexa and Cortana products today are running Sensory technology to wake up the Alexa cloud service.\nSensory’s roots are in neural nets and machine learning. I know everyone does that today, but it was quite out of favor when Sensory used machine learning to create a neural net speech recognition system in the 1990’s and 2000’s. Today everyone and their brother is doing deep learning (yeah that’s tongue in cheek because my brother is doing it too! (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php). And a lot of these deep learning companies are huge multi-billion-dollar business or extremely well-funded startups.\nSo, can Sensory stay ahead now and continuing pioneering innovation in AI now that everyone is using machine learning and doing AI? Of course, the answer is yes!\nSensory is now doing computer vision with convolutional neural nets. We are coming out with deep learning noise models to improve speech recognition performance and accuracy, and are working on small TTS systems using deep learning approaches that help them sound lifelike. And of course, we have efforts in biometrics and natural language that also use deep learning.\nWe are starting to combine a lot of technologies together to show that embedded systems can be quite powerful. And because we have been around longer and thought through most of these implementations years before others, we have a nice portfolio of over 3 dozen patents covering these embedded AI implementations. Hand in hand with Sensory’s improvements in AI software, companies like ARM, NVidia, Intel, Qualcomm and others are investing and improving upon neural net chips that can perform parallel processing for specialized AI functions, so the world will continue seeing better and better AI offerings on “the edge”.\nWhat Makes the Latest Version of TrulySecure so Different?\nA key measure of any biometric system is the inherent accuracy of the matching algorithm. Earlier attempts at face recognition were based on traditional computer vision (CV) techniques. The first attempts involved measuring key distances on the face and comparing those across images, from which the idea of the number of “facial features” associated with an algorithm was born. This method turned out to be very brittle however, especially as the pose angle or expression varied. The next class of algorithms involved parsing the face into a grid, and analyzing each section of the grid individually via standard CV techniques, such as frequency analysis, wavelet transforms, local binary patterns (LBP), etc. Up until recently, these constituted the state of the art in face recognition. Voice recognition has a similar history in the use of traditional signal processing techniques.\nSensory’s TrulySecure uses a deep learning approach in our face and voice recognition algorithms. Deep learning (a subset of machine learning) is a modern variant of artificial neural networks, which Sensory has been using since the very beginning in 1994, and thus we have extensive experience in this area. In just the last few years, deep learning has become the primary technology for many CV applications, and especially face recognition. There have been recent announcements in the news by Google, Facebook, and others on face recognition systems they have developed that outperform humans. This is based on analyzing a data set such as Labeled Faces in the Wild, which has images captured over a very wide ranging set of conditions, especially larger angles and distances from the face. We’ve trained our network for the authentication case, which has a more limited range of conditions, using our large data set collected via AppLock and other methods. This allows us to perform better than those algorithms would do for this application, while also keeping our size and processing power requirements under control (the Google and Facebook deep learning implementations are run on arrays of servers).\nOne consequence of the deep learning approach is that we don’t use a number of points on the face per se. The salient features of a face are compressed down to a set of coefficients, but they do not directly correspond to physical locations or measurements of the face. Rather these “features” are discovered by the algorithm during the training phase – the model is optimized to reduce face images to a set of coefficients that efficiently separate faces of a particular individual from faces of all others. This is a much more robust way of assessing the face than the traditional methods, and that is why we decided to utilize deep learning opposed to CV algorithms for face recognition.\nSensory has also developed a great deal of expertise in making these deep learning approaches work in limited memory or processing power environments (e.g., mobile devices). This combination creates a significant barrier for any competitor to try to switch to a deep learning paradigm. Optimizing neural networks for constrained environments has been part of Sensory’s DNA since the very beginning.\nOne of the most critical elements to creating a successful deep learning based algorithm such as the ones used in TrulySecure is the availability of a large and realistic data set. Sensory has been amassing data from a wide array of real world conditions and devices for the past several years, which has made it possible to train and independently test the TrulySecure system to a high statistical significance, even at extremely low FARs.\nIt is important to understand how Sensory’s TrulySecure fuses the face and voice biometrics when both are available. We implement two different combination strategies in our technology. In both cases, we compute a combined score that fuses face and voice information (when both are present). Convenience mode allows the use of either face or voice or the combined score to authenticate. TrulySecure mode requires both face and voice to match individually.\nMore specifically, Convenience mode checks for one of face, voice, or the combined score to pass the current security level setting. It assumes a willingness by the user to present both biometrics if necessary to achieve authentication, though in most cases, they will only need to present one. For example, when face alone does not succeed, the user would then try saying the passphrase. In this mode the system is extremely robust to environmental conditions, such as relying on voice instead of face when the lighting is very low. TrulySecure mode, on the other hand, requires that both face and voice meet a minimum match requirement, and that the combined score passes the current security level setting.\nTrulySecure utilizes adaptive enrollment to improve FRR with virtually no change in FAR. Sensory’s Adaptive Enrollment technology can quickly enhance a user profile from the initial single enrollment and dramatically improve the detection rate, and is able to do this seamlessly during normal use. Adaptive enrollment can produce a rapid reduction in the false rejection rate. In testing, after just 2 adaptations, we have seen almost a 40% reduction in FRR. After 6 failed authentication attempts, we see more than 60% reduction. This improvement in FRR comes with virtually no change in FAR. Additionally, adaptive enrollment alleviates the false rejects associated with users wearing sunglasses, hats, or trying to authenticate in low-light, during rapid motion, challenging angles, with changing expressions and changing facial hair.\nComments Off on What Makes the Latest Version of TrulySecure so Different?\nComments Off on Will passports one day be secured with biometrics?\nRich Nass and Barbara Quinlan from Open Systems Media visited Sensory on their “IoT Roadshow”.\nI started our meeting off by talking about Sensory’s three products – TrulyHandsfree Voice Control, TrulySecure Authentication, and TrulyNatural large vocabulary embedded speech recognition.\nAlthough TrulyHandsfree is best known for its “always on” capabilities, ideal for listening for key phrases (like OK Google, Hey Cortana, and Alexa), it can be used a ton of other ways. One of them is for hands-free photo taking, so no selfie stick is required. To demonstrate, I put my camera on the table and took pictures of Barbara and Rich. (Normally I might have joined the pictures, but their healthy hair, naturally good looks, and formal attire was too outclassing for my participation).\nThere’s a lot of hype about IoT and Wearables and I’m a big believer in both. That said, I think Amazon’s Echo is the perfect example of a revolutionary product that showcases the use of speech recognition in the IoT space and am looking forward to some innovative uses of speech in Wearables!\nHere’s the article they wrote on their visit to Sensory and an impromptu video showing TrulyNatural performing on-device navigation, as well as a demo of TrulySecure via our AppLock Face/Voice Recognition app.\nIf you’re an IoT device that requires hands-free operation, check out Sensory, just like I did while I was OpenSystems Media’s IoT Roadshow. Sensory’s technology worked flawlessly running through the demo, as you can see in the video. We ran through two different products, one for input and one for security.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T21:00:35Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.sensory.com/category/security/biometrics-security/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"The Dodgers have signed 12 of their 40 picks from the 2014 draft, with eight of those being selected within the top 10 rounds and thus counting against the bonus pool of $4,947,700. The team recently inked fourth-rounder Jeff Brigham and seventh-rounder Trevor Oaks.\nSaving on bonus money is going to be key for the Dodgers draft, simply because Grant Holmes is going to command more than slot. The assumption is that the team is saving money at the tail-end of the bonus pool and that they’ll probably end up going close to five percent over the limit to get a deal with Holmes done. At the end of the day, I would be surprised if he’s able to pass up in excess of two million dollars to sign.\nAll money paid to picks in the first 10 rounds count toward the bonus pool of $4,947,700. Players selected from rounds 11-40 can be paid up to $100,000 without affecting the bonus pool, but whatever amount given over $100,000 counts against the bonus pool.\nSo what’s the penalty for going over?\nUp to 4.999% over ($5,195,084) the team pays a 75% tax on the amount over. Up to 9.999% over ($5,442,469) the team pays the 75% tax on the amount over and loses next year’s first-round pick. Up to 14.999% over ($5,689,854) the team pays a 100% tax on the amount over and loses next year’s first-round and second-round picks. From 15% ($5,689,855) and up the team pays the 100% tax on the amount over and loses the first-round pick for the next two years.\nSo basically the Dodgers can use up to $5,195,084 on this year’s bonus pool draft picks without losing anything significant aside from money.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T05:47:11Z\",\"url\":\"http://dodgersdigest.com/2014/06/13/dodgers-sign-2014-draft-picks-jeff-brigham-4th-trevor-oaks-7th/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"For the past 30 years, we have raised the question of a possible relationship in Belgium between the occurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and age of children (< 15 y) at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in April 1986.\nSuch a relationship was actually demonstrated from the experience of a surgical team with PTC since the Chernobyl accident.\nRadiation exposure affected residents of continental Europe well beyond Ukraine and Belarus. A review of the related scientific literature of the past 30 years demonstrates a persistent higher incidence of PTC among children below 15 at the time of the Chernobyl accident. This relationship with age has been strengthened by the implementation of more sophisticated immunohis- tochemical technology. Some effective lessons can be drawn for the management of the aftermaths of the 2011 Fukushima nu- clear accident, especially for the long term follow-up of populations living in the regions where the radioactive fallouts occurred.\nRadiation exposure to the thyroid during childhood is the most clearly defined environmental risk factor associated with ma- lignant thyroid tumours. The risk of thyroid cancer following irradiation is related to radiation dose and age (greater for children exposed early in life), and the risk persists through- out life. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common radiation-related histologic type [1-3].\nAfter the Chernobyl accident on April 1986, an increase in the prevalence of childhood papillary thyroid carcinoma was ob- served in Belarus and Ukraine, only four years after the acci- dent and continuing up to now [4-8]. An increase of childhood thyroid carcinoma was also present, to a lesser extent, in the Russian Federation .\nThe geographical area most contaminated by releases of radio- active iodine from the damaged nuclear reactor of Chernobyl encompassed the site of the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine, and the region around the city of Gomel in Belarus directly to the north of Chernobyl. The increase in thyroid cancer was partic- ularly pronounced among the youngsters at the time of expo- sure, suggesting that iodine-131 (131I) ̶ the chief component of nuclear accident fallout and an isotope rapidly absorbed by the thyroid gland ̶ was the likely cause of post-Chernobyl PTC in children.\nFrance. The post-Chernobyl Belarus thyroid carcinomas were less influenced by gender, were virtually always papillary, had a greater aggressiveness at presentation, and were more fre- quently associated with thyroid autoimmunity . The results of this large study support the concept that subjects who were younger at the time of radiation exposure had, and continue to have, a greater risk in developing thyroid carcinoma, and strongly suggest that this age group should be carefully moni- tored in the future.\nThe severity of the Chernobyl nuclear accidents had been rat- ed 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), the high- est severity level, and the same as the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Despite numerous and recurrent official denegation, it is clear, in 2016, that the Cher- nobyl accident released a massive amount of various radioac- tive materials, which resulted in radiation exposure of a large number of residents living in former Eastern and Western Eu- rope. Therefore, thirty years after the accident, it remains to ascertain whether the increase in thyroid carcinoma has also extended to adults who were children in April 1986 not only in Belarus and Ukraine but all over Europe.\nPrevious reports [5-11], on post-Chernobyl thyroid carcinoma focused on patients who were children at the time of diagnosis.\nThe most striking feature of thyroid cancers observed in Belar- us children and adolescents after the Chernobyl accident was the distribution pattern resembling a Gaussian curve , with a peak at 10 year, the large majority of the patients (88%) be- ing diagnosed before or at the age of 14 year (mean age at di- agnosis was 11.3 ± 3.1). Such an age distribution is in keeping with the concept that the Belarus thyroid carcinoma outbreak was related to a single event, i.e. massive exposure to radiation action within a limited and defined period of time by the short half-life isotope 131I which has a greater carcinogenic effect in the younger age group . The distribution of thyroid cancer cases in the control series from former Western Europe, ac- cording to the age at diagnosis, increased progressively with the age; the majority (57%) of the patients being diagnosed after the age of 14 year (mean age at diagnosis was 14.6 ± 4.2) .\nis extremely rare (0.5 to 3 per million children per year) , during the same period, we performed thyroid operations in 18 children or adolescents among which the four PTC were found (22 %). Before April 1986, we did not operate on any childhood PTC and the percentage of PTC cancer found in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery was 6%.\n3.2 Bq.m-3 per year in Belgium. From 1-3 May 1986 (arrival of the first radioactive cloud from Chernobyl over Belgium), the mean daily value of radioactivity rose to over 70 Bq.m-3 per day. By comparison, the mean daily value of radioactivity mea- sured at ground level by the BRIM on 2nd and 3rd May, 1986 in Belgium was 20-fold higher than the mean daily values mea- sured during and after a period of 110 important atmospheric nuclear bomb tests in 1961 and 1962 in the middle of the Cold War; and a hundred times the radioactivity measured in Bel- gium (700 mBq.m-3 per day) on 11th and 12th October, 1957, after the nuclear accident in Winscale, UK (now called Sella- field). Based on these consecutive four cases of childhood PTC and the evidence of high radioactivity exposure in early May 1986, we thus raised the question of a possible relationship in Belgium between the occurrence of PTC and age of those children at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident, taking into account that the overall incidence of childhood PTC in Belarus and Ukraine rose significantly [4-8,14].\nFurthermore, from January 2000 to January 2002, we operat- ed on five other patients for papillary carcinoma follicular vari- ant, who were respectively 8, 8, 10, 11 and 12-year-old at the time of the Chernobyl accident . Apart from age, this ini- tial cohort of nine patients also had the presence of psammo- ma bodies in two and elevated thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) in three [12,15]. We, therefore, pursued the prospec- tive recording of all patients born before April 1986 operated for thyroid pathologies during the following three decades ex- tending up to April 2015 .\nIn April 2011, in an effort to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy our Pathology department added several immunohis- tochemical (IHC) biomarkers [17,18] [cytokeratin 19 (CK 19), galectin-3 and HBME-1, a monoclonal antibody to an unknown microvillous surface antigen present on mesothelial cells]. to the classical cytological and histological investigations. IHC is able to recognize specific proteins on cytological or histolog- ical specimens . All thyroid diagnostic immunomarkers share the ability to be expressed when the carcinoma appears. HBME1 is expressed in the majority of PTCs, showing diffuse strong staining. Similarly, CK19 consistently overexpressed in PTC, in both the classic and the follicular variant. Galectin-3, a member of the B galactosil binding lectin family, for which nor- mal functions include cell-cell regulation, growth, and appears to be a discriminating marker of well-differentiated follicular derived neoplasms [19-21]. The role of cell cycle regulatory protein, such as Cyclin D1, in the progression of thyroid cancer is another promising diagnostic factor . In summary, all these antibodies can have a confirmatory role in distinguish- ing the follicular variants of PTC and follicular adenoma. For challenging encapsulated follicular lesions with questionable features of PTC, these antibodies can be helpful; their limita- tion perhaps suggesting the biologic ambiguity of the lesions [18-22].\nIn our experience  out of a total of 2349 patients having undergone thyroid surgery for all types of lesions during the three decades after Chernobyl and born before April 1986, 2164 were above 15 years of age at the time of the Chernobyl accident (group A) and 175 developed PTC (8.1%) compared to 36 PTC (19.5%) that occurred in 185 children under 15 years of age (group B) in April 1986 (p<0.001). Actually, we were expecting that with time this difference would have fad- ed away due to the implementation of the more sophisticated diagnostic IHC allowing more accurate and earlier diagnosis of PTC, as well as less inter-observer variability in the evaluation of lesions  both in and between groups A and B. However, interestingly the gap of PTC incidence between groups A and B widened after the introduction in 2011 of IHC biomarkers. The use of these novel IHC markers did not reduce the difference in incidences between groups A and B, but instead widened it . This fact constitutes an additional argument in favor of a long term follow up of children aged less than 15-year-old at the time of Chernobyl accident. It also contradicts a major study  that suggested the epidemic of radiation-induced thyroid cancer in children reached its peak in 1993, with a trend to a plateau in the following years. This study did not exclude, however, the possibility of a second peak occurring in the next few decades and having a longer latency period, simi- lar to that observed after therapeutic external radiation to the head and neck [23-25].\nThe sources of information on the thyroid cancer risk after radiation exposure during childhood or adolescence after the nuclear plant accident of Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 [1-11], demonstrate that more than 70% of the thyroid dose of the population in the contaminated area was due to 131I (half-life of 8 days), explaining the subsequent large increase of the thy- roid cancer incidence in Belarus  and in Ukraine [27,28]. A case-control study including 107 thyroid cancer cases and two matched control groups of similar size indicated a strong relationship between thyroid cancer and radiation dose from the Chernobyl accident . In another study , the excess absolute cancer risk per unit thyroid dose for the birth cohort 1971–1985 (i.e. age range similar to our group B of patients less than 15 years at the time of the Chernobyl accident) was found for the observation period of 4.6–9.6 years after the ex-posure to be 2.1 (95% CI 1.0–4.5) cases per 104 person-year Gy (ie. Gy for Gray, the unit of absorbed ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units). In fact, those results were obtained from cohort studies of individuals whose thyroid 131I activity was measured during the first two months after the accident. They demonstrate that the average thyroid doses to small children were about five times higher than the average doses to adults .\nHowever, correlation does not imply causation. For instance, the dose evaluation remains an important issue that must be considered, especially for the evaluation of dose-response re- lationship after the more recent 2011 Fukushima accident. In- deed, the accumulated knowledge from the data on the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has, for a long time, been the basis of our understanding of the dose-response rela- tionship for the risk of late health effects, including PTC. Since the risk estimates have been discussed mainly from the epide- miological data obtained from the atomic bomb survivors, who received high doses at extremely high-dose rate, these risk es- timates may not be appropriately applied to populations re- ceiving lower dose radiation exposure.\nSuch possible drawbacks, including also (a) long observation times necessary to gather enough cancer cases to achieve statistical power, and (b) uncertainties of individual thyroid radiation doses due to unknown thyroid mass at time of the Chernobyl accident, must be overcome before implying that 131I radiation is the cause of PTC in people who were aged un- der 15 at time of the Chernobyl accident. We tried to overcome those drawbacks by prospectively recording the data from our surgical experience over the three decades since the Chernobyl accident in order to obtain relevant, valid and easily accessible data. Thanks to our study results, we can recommend that ev- ery practitioner facing a patient with a thyroid problem should check, as a simple first step, the date of birth. If she or he was aged less than 15-year-old, or even more significantly less than ten or five-year-old in April 1986, the physician must investi- gate thoroughly for the presence of thyroid cancer.\nThese drawbacks have also been be minimized in aggregate studies that decrease asymptomatic bias provided the co- variate sample size in each cohort is important. Two such ag- gregate studies [4,30] of the thyroid cancer incidence in the contaminated areas of Belarus and Ukraine demonstrated the large potential of such analyses to derive quantitative results on the thyroid cancer risk after 131I exposures.\nterm well-differentiated tumours of uncertain malignant po- tential (UMP) for such lesions in which the cytological features are not severe enough to provide an unequivocal diagnosis of PTC. These tumours have been suggested as possible precur- sors to invasive PTC. However, this term has not been accept- ed universally as a diagnostic term, and uncertainty remains about the nature of these lesions and their relationship to PTC. In an attempt to resolve this diagnostic difficulty, many IHC markers have been evaluated for their potential in distinguish- ing PTC from other follicular lesions. Proposed markers of PTC include HBME-1, galectin-3, specific cytokeratins (CK) such as CK19 . Only rarely are all three markers negative in PTC; this panel therefore provides an objective and reproducible tool for the analysis of difficult thyroid nodules particularly since the introduction of follicular variant of PTC . Experts consider that a panel of these IHC markers is of value to dis- tinguish PTC from other thyroid follicular lesion, and is also helpful in the diagnosis of the follicular variant PTC. According to our experience, this was the case for the definitive diagnosis of PTC in 18 out of 22 patients (82%) from group A, and 11 out of 14 PTC patients from group B (79%) since April 2011. In addition, one study demonstrated a significant overexpression of cyclin D1 in aggressive thyroid carcinoma compared with conventional papillary carcinoma . In our experience, cy- clin D1 has contributed to the diagnosis of PTC in four patients (two in group A and two in group B) .\nIn the last decades, thyroid cancer incidence has increased continuously all over the world as demonstrated by one recent epidemiological review . Many experts believe that the increased incidence of thyroid cancer is due to the increased detection of small cancers in the preclinical stage due to more sensitive diagnostic procedures, as well as the addition of new IHC markers to the histological exam of surgical specimen. Thus, the difference of incidences of PTC between our groups A and B could have been expected to reduce with time . This, however, was not the case, with a continuous increase of PTC incidence in group A (>15 year in 1986) over the three decades since the Chernobyl accident. Therefore, increased ra- diation exposure remains the most likely contributing factor for increased rates of PTC in patients aged less than 15 years in 1986 [1,16,33].\nand the dose distribution in tissues (whole body distribution after Hiroshima versus variable distribution depending on the types of isotopes after Chernobyl), all differ . Furthermore, after Chernobyl, amounts of radioactivity were detected for months around the whole northern hemisphere and not only in the most exposed areas of Belarus, Ukraine and the Soviet Union in 1986 .\nAs a matter of comparison, the nuclear bomb, called Little Boy, dropped by the B-29 flying superfortress Enola Gay on Au- gust 6, 1945 on Hiroshima was a uranium-fueled bomb that held 140 pounds of uranium, and exploded nearly 2000 feet above the city. In contrast, it is estimated that about seven to ten tons of nuclear fuel were released as a result of the explo- sion of reactor number 4 of the Chernobyl power plant that melted down at ground level, releasing volatile radioisotopes for months. Most experts agree that the areas in the 30 kilome- tres Chernobyl exclusion zone are still very contaminated with radioactive isotopes like caesium-137 and strontium-90, and, therefore, are unsafe for human habitation. Yet neither Naga- saki nor Hiroshima still suffer these conditions. The difference is attributable to three factors: (a) the Chernobyl reactor had a far greater amount of nuclear fuel; (b) that was much more efficiently used in nuclear reactions; and (c) the whole mess exploded at ground level. Little Boy detonated in mid-air allow- ing an important amount of radioactive debris to be dispersed by the mushroom cloud rather than being drilled on and into the earth. Today, over 1.6 million people live in Hiroshima, yet the Chernobyl exclusion zone, a 30 square kilometres area sur- rounding the plant, remains relatively uninhabited.\nA survey study published in 2014  investigating 3087 Hi- roshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors, aged less than 10 years old at exposure, demonstrated 62 to 66 years after their exposure 47 cases (1.8%) of thyroid cancers.\nThirty years after the Chernobyl accident, and despite the 2011 Fukushima accident, the consequences of nuclear power plant accident to human health continue to be widely denied often without proper arguments. One Belgian retrospective study published in 2008, and based on hospital discharge data, dealt with the incidence of surgically removed thyroid carci- noma (some histological types being not radiation-induced cancers) in Belgium ten years after Chernobyl . In addition to the poor validity of their retrospective study, the authors did not give a balanced picture of the atmospheric radioactive contamination in early May, 1986 as reported in the Belgian Royal Institute of Meteorology document [13, 36]. The main risk factor is the radiation dose to the thyroid; the Chernobyl accident is estimated to have released approximately 1.7 x 1018 Bq of 131I in the atmosphere in the areas around Chernobyl , but also over the northern hemisphere [12,13,33,36]. After the Chernobyl accident, the basic measures of protection and precaution were not taken at the level of the entire Euro- pean continent, that was still divided by the Iron Curtain, such as early iodine supplementation for children (at the exception of Poland), and effective long term follow-up of all young- sters in the aftermath of the nuclear accident. For the following three decades after Chernobyl, an effective and efficient pub- lic health recommendation might have been to insist lowering the threshold to investigate patients presenting with thyroid lesions, who were aged less than 15 years of age in April 1986. This has been our policy for the past three decades [12,15,16] which probably explains that the majority of cases were T1 – T2 and N0. As we mentioned, from May 1 to 3, 1986 (the arrival of the first nuclear clouds from Chernobyl over Belgium ), the mean daily value of radioactivity rose to over 70 Bq.m-3 per day. By comparison, in Poland the initial detection of atmo- spheric radioactivity on April 27 and 28 was up to 504 Bq.m-3 of 131I, with 1.55 to 3.0 higher values in northeast Poland. Furthermore, in Warsaw on April 28, 28% of the air ra- dioactivity was present as short-lived (8 days) isotopes of 131I. Because reliable information was not available from Russia, Polish health authorities based their decisions on a worst case scenario; therefore, all children under 16 years of age received prophylactic potassium iodide (KI). KI was well tolerated, as shown by the Polish experience of administering it to a large population after the Chernobyl accident (10.5 million children and 7 million adults) . The incidence of medically signifi- cant, but mild reactions (skin rashes, headache, vomiting, mild gastrointestinal disorders) to KI was low (0.2%)  demon- strating that KI distribution at a population level was a safe response. However, treatment with KI should begin as soon as possible after exposure, and continued, if necessary, for the du- ration of the exposure. In April 1986, the late admission of the nuclear accident by the Soviet Union authorities delayed by at least 48-hour the KI distribution in Poland.\nIn March 2011, Japanese officials failed to take early the de- cision to hand out KI pills to thousands of people. A decision that could minimize risk of radiation-induced injury from the nuclear accident. The disclosure of this error by the Wall Street Journal on September 2, 2011 was one of the first evidences of government neglect of emergency procedures in the chaotic weeks after the nuclear disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant .\nTwo explosions occurred in Chernobyl, the first due to steam and a second due to hydrogen. Both explosions expelled fission products and fuel elements to the exterior that were drilled into the soil, but also accumulated on the ground and in a cloud reaching to approximately 7000 m and centred at 4500 m. The Chernobyl nuclear plant was equipped with early generation reactor RBMK (Reaktor Bolshoy Moshchnosti Kanalnyy), actu- ally an old class of graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor designed by the Soviet Union. The Chernobyl reactor lacked the secondary containment found in modern nuclear power plants. As a consequence, when the graphite core ignited, there was a second, more prolonged release over a 9- to 10-day pe- riod that peaked on May 6, 1986, and began to drop only on May 11. We hope that these aspects of the Chernobyl disaster have been taken into account by the Japanese health authori- ties faced in March 2011 with the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident. We have some doubts, however, as we did not hear in 2011 about an equivalent mass media mobilization, as in Poland in 1986, to announce the protective action of KI and to appeal for volunteers to assist in a nationwide distribution of KI pills, especially in small villages .\nIt is worth mentioning that in August 1997, the U.S. National Cancer Institute acknowledged radiation exposure to millions of children during above ground nuclear weapons tests in the early 1950s and 1960s during the cold war . More specif- ically, in 1983, the U.S. Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to assess the potential exposure of the American people to 131I, one of the radioactive elements also found in the fallout from aboveground nuclear tests. The media blitz that followed this report heightened interest and concern among the public about thyroid cancer. In January 1997, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published the “AACE Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Thyroid Carcinoma”, and conducted the “Stick Your Neck Out, America” campaign to assist patients in recognizing and detecting thyroid cancer.\nThe type and molecular pathology of the thyroid tumours is changing with increasing latency; long latency tumours in oth- er organs could occur also in the future. Therefore, a compre- hensive follow up must continue for the lifetime of those ex- posed. Whenever a physical examination is done, the physician must always examine the thyroid and neck area. If a nodule or protrusion is seen or felt, ultrasonography possibly completed by needle biopsy should be done. Although a thyroid scan, ul- trasound, or blood test may also be required, the thyroid nee- dle biopsy is the best test to determine if a nodule is benign or is cancerous and requires surgery. We made the same type of plea in our papers of -2001  and 2002  and suggest- ed that a long term epidemiological survey be considered at a European level.\nIncidence of thyroid cancer is increasing, which is probably due to better screening, and more effective preoperative di- agnostic techniques. Significant progress has been made due to the development of several IHC biomarkers to complement the cytological and histological investigations on surgical spec- imens. This is clearly demonstrated in our study  by the rising incidence of PTC, both in group A and in group B, since April 2011 corresponding to the routine implementation of the novel IHC biomarkers. However, the persisting significant difference in incidence between groups A and B during the past three decades cannot be explained only by those consid- erations. Indeed, if radiation-exposed adults may also develop PTC, their risk remains lower than for radiation-exposed chil- dren.\nBecause the thyroid is extremely sensitive to radioiodine in early childhood, due in part to the small size of the gland, one might also expect the foetus to be vulnerable. Moreover, the proliferative activity of fetal thyroid cells is high compared to children or adults . To date, however, information about thyroid cancer risks associated with in utero exposure to Cher- nobyl fallout is very limited. In 2000, an ultrasound screen- ing study of Belarusian school children living within 150 km of the Chernobyl plant examined rates of thyroid cancer among those exposed prenatally (n=2409) and those exposed before three years of age (n=9720), and found higher rates in the postnatally exposed group compared with the in utero ex- posed (0.32%, n=31 cases vs. 0.09%, n=1 case, respectively). More recent (2003–2006) screening studies of 2582 individ- uals in northern Ukraine who were in utero during the period of Chernobyl fallout [42,43] calculated the dose-response rela- tionship for thyroid cancer using individually estimated foetal thyroid 131I doses for each member of the cohort . The Ex- cess Relative Risk/Gy (ERR/Gy), based on seven prenatally ex- posed cases of thyroid cancer, was 11.9 (P=0.12), substantially higher but not significant nor statistically different from the ERR/Gy of 3.24 estimated for a group of children exposed at 1–5 years of age (n=13 cases, P=0.01). The studies in Ukraine [42,43] had a longer period of follow-up than the earlier study in Belarus  (approximately 20 years versus 14 years) and more accurate dosimetric data but, although suggestive, it is by no means conclusive. The breakdown of the thyroid doses as a function of the stage of pregnancy shows that the dose increas- es substantially with the stage of pregnancy [42,43]. The low- est thyroid doses were estimated for subjects whose estimated foetal ages were less than 90 days at the time of the accident. Thyroid dose estimates generally increased with the stage of development, but also depend upon individual circumstances reported by the mothers.\nIn our experience with three PTC out of six prenatally exposed children , one was related to a young girl whose estimated foetal age was 35 weeks on April 26, 1986. She was born on April 30, 1986 and operated on in 1998 for bilateral multiple microscopic PTC at the age of 12 years. She was referred after a CT scan (without contrast injection) performed for a neck inju- ry revealed concentrically punctuate calcifications in the right thyroid lobe suggestive of psammoma bodies, which were con- firmed by histology . The two other cases were T1aN0 and T2N0 PTC operated at age 22 and 23 years, whose foetal age on April 26, 1986 were 4 and 8 weeks respectively.\nClearly the issue of in utero radiation exposure will require ad- ditional research to establish both its role in thyroid cancer ae- tiology and the relative radiosensitivity of the prenatal versus the postnatal thyroid gland. We hope that such long term, pop- ulation-based, research is under way in the Fukushima area.\nFew data are available. The possibility of a mother passing contaminated milk to her infant through breastfeeding is real. Independent tests on nine breast milk samples collected on March 24 and March 30 in the Fukushima region found radio- active 131I in four nursing mothers – all of them living far from the exclusion zone. In fact, lactating may be more susceptible to ionizing radiation, as breast tissue bio-accumulates iodine as part of the physiological process of its accumulation in breast milk. These levels of accumulated radioiodine in breast milk may also increase the risk of thyroid cancer in newborns [44-46]. Our patient born on April 30, 1986 with a foetal age of 35 weeks on April 1986, who developed multiple microscopic bilateral foci of PTC at age 12, was breastfed. Powdered milk formula for infants might have been better. However, in April 1986, cow’s milk radioactivity varied widely from day to day, but as expected, remained elevated long after contamina- tion of the air had subsided . Once more, Poland can serve as an example: powdered milk programme initiated on April 2937 lasted until May 7, when cow’s milk radioactivity values had progressively declined and was judged safe for human consumption. At the same time, restriction of leavy vegetables was recommended.\nThe Belgian Royal Institute of Meteorology (BRIM) report [13,36] is straightforward in its conclusions about the increase of atmospheric and ground level radioactivity in Western and Eastern Europe in late April and early May, 1986. This import- ant piece of meteorological information can be extrapolated to the entire continent. More specifically, the radioactive cloud reached Belgium on May1st, 1986. Some authors  have de- liberately overlooked those clear facts by pretending that ra- dioactivity caused by the Chernobyl accident in Belgium was negligible. Furthermore, they supported their statement by one reference related to a survey of the 137Cs contamination in Belgium a decade after the Chernobyl accident . Late ef- fects of 137Cs contamination has nothing to do with the massive early 131I contamination that represented 80% of the isotopes found in air samples taken during the first two weeks after the nuclear accident , and that deposited on the ground, grass and sand in Western Europe during the spring of 1986. In ad- dition, the radioactivity of 137Cs is 1400 times less than 131I, that can also be ingested via irradiated cow’s milk according to an early survey made in the Fukushima prefecture after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011 .\nAfter the Fukushima accident the minimum detectable activ- ities (MDAs) for 137Cs were ≤ 3.5 Bq kg-1 for ages 0-1year, de- creasing to ≤ 2 Bq kg-1 for ages 10-11 year. Including the 134Cs contribution, these translate to a maximum effective dose of 16µSv year-1 even for new born babies, and therefore the in- ternal exposure risks can be considered negligibly small . In contrast to Chernobyl, although both accidents were in the same level 7 of the International Nuclear Event Scale, the ma- jority of children residing in the town of Miharu regularly con- sumed local or home-grown rice and vegetables, while in the town of Minamisoma, the majority avoid tap water and pro- duces from Fukushima prefecture. The data show, however, no correlation between consumption of locally produced food and water and the children’s body burdens . Those impressive Japanese data have been obtained thanks to the development in 2013 (two years after the nuclear power accident) of the BABYSCAN, a whole body counter (WBC) for small children. WBC units have been installed at three hospitals in Fukushima Prefecture. Between December, 2013 and March, 2015, 2702 children between the ages of 0 and 11 have been scanned, and none had detectable levels of radioactive caesium (half-life of 137Cs is 30.17 years). However, the measurements were made 33 to 49 months after the accident, which, as a consequence, eliminates the BABYSCAN as an effective tool for evaluation of the contamination by 131I, whose half-life is eight days.\nSome authors recommend to measure serum thyroglobulin (Tg), as its increase can be related to the risk of developing tumour following radiation treatment of benign thyroid con- ditions (e.g. toxic adenoma) . In a study of 172 children with cancer, including 47 who were treated with radiation, thyroglobulin measurements were useful in identifying thy- roid tumours . However, a validated absolute risk model for second primary thyroid cancer among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer having received radiation did not include se- rum thyroglobulin level as a risk factor .\nIt has also been hypothesized that the increased prevalence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) in thyroid cancers could be due to an enhanced presentation of thyroid tumour anti- gens to the immune system, although this point is controversial . If Tg is a well-established tumour marker in the follow-up of these patients, it is important to underline that retention of TgAb positivity reflects persistent disease, whereas the loss of TgAb positivity suggests a cure .\nantibodies to peroxidase and (less frequently) to thyroglobulin were detected. These figures should be compared with the 20% frequency of lymphocytic infiltration and humoral thyroid au- toimmunity found in other Western European series . All to- gether, these data suggest that thyroid autoimmune reactions may also be related to radiation exposure. This interpretation is in keeping with the observation of thyroid autoimmune phe- nomena in several survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in August 1945 [4,56], as well as in subjects exposed to radiation fallout from military nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands during the Cold war from 1946 to 1958, including the first U.S. hydrogen bomb tested in 1952 [57,58]. It is worth noting that in 1956, the United States Atomic Energy Commission regard- ed the Marshall Islands as “by far the most contaminated place in the world” .\nIt is likely that thyroid autoimmunity may be an additional and important consequence of the Chernobyl accident. Thus, this potential risk must also be taken into account for the long term follow-up of people living in the nuclear fallout areas around Fukushima.\nThirty years have passed since the Chernobyl accident led to exposure of millions of people in Europe. Studies of popula- tions  exposed have provided significant new information on radiation risks, particularly in relation to thyroid tumours following exposure to iodine isotopes. Recent studies among Chernobyl liquidators  have also provided evidence of increases in the risk of leukaemia and other haematological malignancies and of cataracts, and suggestions of increases in the risk of cardiovascular diseases, following low doses and low dose rates of radiation. Further careful follow-up of these populations, and long-term support of life-span study cohorts, may continue to provide important information for the quan- tification of radiation risks and the protection of persons ex- posed to low doses of radiation .\n was less optimistic. The individual external doses were estimated by using digitized behaviour data and a computer program that included daily gamma ray dose maps drawn af- ter the accident. The individual external doses of 421,394 res- idents for the first four months (excluding radiation workers) had a distribution as follows: 62% < 1mSv, 94% < 2mSv, 99% < 3mSv. If the arithmetic mean was only 0.8 mSv, the maximum for the individual external dose was nevertheless 25 mSv. Fur- thermore, the response rate to the self-administered question- naire and the participation in the survey, that was not compul- sory, was only 26%. Thus, there is room for discussion about the results in terms of population safety. In addition, for chil- dren, the highest four-month dose was within a range of 10-11 mSv for each group of ages 0-9 year and 10-19 year. Higher dose (> 15mSv) were seen mainly for persons with delayed moves from the evacuation areas after the accident .\nIn 2016, a large panel of scientists from the Radiation Medical Centre for the Fukushima Health Management Survey  has implemented large monitoring projects that include the basic survey of the local populations for the estimation of external radiation doses received during the first 4 months after the accident, and four detailed surveys: thyroid ultrasound exam- ination, comprehensive health check-up, mental health and lifestyle survey, and survey on pregnant women and nursing mothers, with the aim to prospectively take care of the health of all the residents of Fukushima prefecture for a long time. Last but not least, the panel also insisted on the fact that, among evacuees of the Fukushima accident, concern about ra- diation risk is associated with psychological stresses. There- fore, ongoing health risk management must also be focused on the difficult challenge of post-disaster recovery and resilience after a nuclear plant accident .\nSome progresses have been made in the field of measures that have to be taken in the event of a nuclear accident in several countries. In addition to international conventions concerning information exchange between countries (the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA and the European Union), nation- al nuclear emergency plans are defined by law. These emer- gency plans primarily concern the major nuclear plants. Trans- port incidents and radiological terrorism are also theoretically taken into account.\nThe accident of Fukushima of March 2011 and the accident of April 1986 were of the same severity level. However, immedi- ately after the Fukushima accident, and in contrast to the Cher- nobyl accident, appropriate countermeasures including evacu- ation, sheltering and control of food chain were implemented in a timely manner by the Japanese government according to official reports.63,64 Nonetheless, this is somewhat in contra- diction with earlier report . Concerning the risk of thyroid cancer, it is well known that not only external but also internal exposure to radioactive iodine can increase it [1,65,66]. Once again, the most important modifier of radiation-induced thy- roid cancer risk mentioned is age at exposure, and elevated risk faints among people exposed after the age of 20-30 . In this sense, the measures taken in Fukushima are rather en- couraging in terms of the strategy for prevention of radiation induced thyroid cancer. According to more precise estimated data from the local residents in Fukushima , the whole body absorbed doses were below 3mSv in general during the first four months after the accident. The most important point, however, is the thyroid dose evaluation in Fukushima suggest- ing the maximum not exceeding 35mSv in thyroid equivalent dose (between 0-15 mSv for 98% of children in Iwaki city, Kawamata town and Litate village in the Fukushima Prefec- ture) in a realistic manner in comparison with the data obtained from the Chernobyl study (90% above 15mSv and 54% above 200mSv among the evacuees in Belarus) [59, 69].\nAt this stage, it is worth mentioning that in a Report of the Rus- sian Scientific Committee on Radiological Protection , re- leased in 2013, one can read: “It should be concluded that cur- rently available preliminary radiation doses estimates show that after Fukushima nuclear power plant accident doses of the public resulting from this accident were significantly lower than those after the Chernobyl accident. Possibly, this is due both to differences in levels of radioactive environmental con- tamination as a result of these accidents and timely evacuation of people from the most contaminated areas around Fukushi- ma nuclear power plant, as well as measures undertaken in Ja- pan to prevent consumption of contaminated food ” .\nA recent molecular analytical study  showed that the ge- netic profile of Fukushima thyroid cancers was completely different from that of post-Chernobyl radiation-associated thyroid cancers in young patients. Regarding radiation-in- duced thyroid carcinomas, post-Chernobyl paediatric PTCs had RET/PTC rearrangements detected in more than 50% [71- 73]. RET/PTC3 was found in 64-86% of the tumours with short latency (4-8 years after the exposure) , whereas tumours that developed after longer period of time had RET/PTC1 pre- dominantly.\nBy comparison, the Fukushima experience  demonstrates a high prevalence of BRAFV600E mutation (63.2%) and low fre- quency of chromosomal rearrangements such as RET/PTC (10.3%) in young PTC cases found in Japan by the thyroid ul- trasound screening program.\nIn the early period (2004-2005) after the discovery of the BRAF mutation in thyroid cancers, its prevalence in paediat- rics PTCs was reported to be only 0-20% [75-78]. However, the studies analysed a limited number of cases. So far, the Japanese scientists cannot explain the discrepancy between results of molecular studies made in the post-Chernobyl era and more recently after the Fukushima accident. However, several expla- nations have been raised. First, the increase in BRAF mutation may be due to improved sensitivity of detection methods: use of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and pyrose- quencing. Secondly, the prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation depends on population and iodine intake . In Japan, iodine intake is high and in Belarus iodine deficiency was frequent in children before 1986 . Thirdly, the post-Fukushima thy- roid ultrasound screening program was much more extensive, systematic and sensitive  than after the Chernobyl acci- dent, allowing detection of thyroid tumours of smaller size and earlier in life. In fact, no high-resolution ultrasound apparatus was available early after the Chernobyl accident in Belarus. Consistent with this hypothesis, are the results of the Japanese survey demonstrating that thyroid tumours with the BRAFV600E mutation were significantly smaller than BRAFV600E –negative cases .\nIn January 2016, the members (mainly from Poland) of the GENRISK-T project (EU grant FP6 36495)  published the results of a study aimed at establishing whether individual ge- netic factors influence the risk of developing cancer of the thy- roid after exposure to ionizing radiation. The study searched for global differences in molecular profiles in tumour tissue from patients who were either exposed to Chernobyl radi- ation as children (exposed to Chernobyl radiation, ECR) or were born after 1 January 1987 and therefore not exposed to radiation (not exposed to Chernobyl radiation, non-ECR). Both groups resided in the same areas so that potential confounding factors (e.g. environment) were minimized. Gene expression profiles with respect to intrinsic potential confounding factors including age at PTC diagnosis, mutational status and histolog- ical subtype of PTC were also investigated. An important fea- ture of the investigated PTC patients was their young age in the ECR group (median 2.3 year, range 0.1-8.3) in April 1986; age at diagnosis of PTC: median 17.7, range 14.7 – 24.5. There were significant, but subtle, differences in gene expression profiles between non-ECR PTC and ECR PTC associated with previous low-dose radiation exposure at time of the Chernobyl acci- dent. Ten genes (PPME1, HDAC11, SOCS7, CIC, THRA, ERBB2, PPP1R9A, HDGF, RAD51AP1, and CDK1) from the 19 investi- gated with quantitative RT-PCR were confirmed as being asso- ciated with radiation exposure in an independent, validation set of samples. The BRAF mutation exhibited independent ef- fects on the PTC expression profile.\nThe great majority of post-Chernobyl tumours are papillary cancers. Those radiation-induced thyroid cancers are not more aggressive than sporadic cancers  and, so far, there is no radiation–specific molecular marker . However, dietary iodine levels may have wide implications in radiation induced thyroid carcinogenesis, and iodine deficiency that was present in Belarus in 1986, could have increased incidence, reduced latency, and influenced tumour morphology and aggressive- ness [79,80]. Therefore, dietary iodine status is important in thyroid cancer susceptibility after radioactive fallout These findings reinforce the need to prevent iodine deficiency generally .\nContinued surveillance of trends in cancer incidence, includ- ing thyroid cancer, is an important priority to evaluate the pub- lic health impact of the nuclear plant accidents and should con- tinue until the complete burden of Chernobyl-related disease has been fully characterized. Much has still to be learned from the Chernobyl accident and from the more recent accident of Fukushima.\nCoordinators of National Cancer Registries all over the world should organise long-term assessment and follow-up of the thyroid status of citizens who were younger than 15 years in April 1986 to shed light on the existence – or not – of a per- sistent significant relationship between low-dose radiation af- ter Chernobyl and PTC .\nDecision-makers’ hubris ends in bad policy choice and en- courages shoddy practice. Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them. The Japanese author- ities admitted that they did not concretely learn lessons from the Chernobyl disaster, and that their nuclear plants did not reach A Level of Risk as Low as Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). Among other things, they now recommend to establish a system for long-term follow-up of all children at the time of nucle- ar power plant accident in order to overcome the uncertainty of low-dose effects of radiation, but also to monitor their phys- ical and mental health .\nThe determining factors of risk perception have been relative- ly well analysed in Fukushima, and these observations should offer valuable information for further Certain Japanese scientists recognize that the nuclear disaster of Fukushima has changed pre-existing and emerging issues such as sense of val- ue on human life and public risk awareness and perception.64There is clearly a new challenge to be met in order to establish a transparent radiation protection culture in Japan (and else- where), to better communicate on radiation risk, and to gain real social trust, as well as a new confidence in experts and politicians In other words, to meet the challenge of credibility.\nAfter the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, ra- diation exposure affected residents of regions well beyond Ukraine and Belarus. This has been clearly demonstrated by a 1990 meteorological report that did not receive wide diffu- sion until we happened to obtain it from the BRIM5 in the late nineties [13, 36].\nMore recently, after the Fukushima nuclear plant accident, some Japanese medical officers warned us that it will take a long time to extract a living lesson from Fukushima “since we are still in the middle of confusion and absurdity to develop and implement a trustable countermeasure that would cover the multi-dimensional aspects of a whole human life, some- what similar to the proverbial six blind men trying to deter- mine an elephant by touch .” This metaphor from Japan illustrates what the Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievitch – 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature – described already in her 1997 book Voices from Chernobyl . This living lesson, already 20-year-old, was never published by Belarusian state-owned publishing houses.\nRon E, Lubin JH, Shore RE, Mabuchi K, Modan B et al.

{"text":"Snoh Aalegra is quickly climbing in the music world. She just released her music video for her brand new RZA-produced single “Emotional,” and let me tell you, she truly lets it all out. You can sense Snoh’s natural ability to express herself through the video and it’s quite beautiful. Snoh definitely exudes confidence: she doesn’t care who is watching as long as they are listening to her, and I think that’s what makes her so special. There’s something rather uplifting about seeing somebody release all of their pain, so I decided to sit down with her to figure how she does it while looking so STUNNING. See her tips on how to NOT be emotional below!\nHow can our Galore Girls feel better from negative EMOTIONS?\n1. Go and have some dessert! Food makes me happy and I promise chocolate is going to make you happy. Oh, if you’re in LA and you want Swedish candy, go to Sockerbit on 3rd Street. I promise it’s amazing, Swedish chocolate is everything.\n2. Go workout! That is the best way to release all of your tension. If you just sweat it all out and get really tired, you’ll feel better right away.\n3. Organize your life! When I’m really angry or emotional, I tend to do a major cleanup at home. It will distract you from thinking about what’s making you upset and you can stay focused on what’s important and make room for all the new stuff.\nAny tips on ways to cover up your tears?\nBuy waterproof eye makeup! Dior Blackout Waterproof Mascara & Liner is my favorite. Always carry makeup remover. I love using the NARS makeup remover.\nWhat was your favorite part about filming this video?\nI actually had the worst flu of my life while filming, so that mixed with the feelings of my four year long relationship ending made the entire process EXTREMELY emotional for me. I was feeling every single lyric in the song and I cried in the video. So to answer your question, my favorite part of the video was my ability to be free. I got to be completely free.

I invited Joan Lombardi to discuss the Alliance idea (which was mostly hers) over the lunch idea (which was mostly mine). Lombardi was sharing her mid-day thoughts before entering President Kerry's administration as a result of the expected outcome that evening. Then, the voters voted and at least one really great thing happened as a result. The Alliance, under Lombardi's founding leadership, was born.\nThe Alliance in its first year, 2005, was a $1.5 million line item in the budget of the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, which I then served as its founding president. It has since grown, under Lisa Klein's direction, into a $7 million plus per year enterprise funded by more than a half dozen national early childhood philanthropies. Their pooled resources advance a shared agenda whose administration is delegated to Klein and her able colleagues, Steff Clothier and Helene Stebbins who were, to continue the rough Biblical metaphor, more or less there on the First Day of the Alliance's creation.\nAs I step down this year as chairman of the Alliance's board, I have never been more confident in the future of our cause. Think about it. We now live in a world where birth-to-three champions and UPK champions are no longer at daggers drawn. Early success now rests upon broader shoulders. We all see more clearly, I think, the importance of the entire continuum that begins prenatally and profoundly influences who can read well and who cannot, who can play well and who cannot, who is healthy and who is not -- upon arrival at third grade and beyond third grade. We now live in a world where a New York Times' columnist on the right (David Brooks) and a columnist on the left (Nicholas Kristof) make essentially the same argument -- repeatedly, thank God -- about the wisdom of our policy propositions. And if you want a litmus test for bi-partisanship, that's a pretty good one. Finally, we now live in a world where a President of the United States has made a $75 billion (75 B's, not the M's we are used to in \"good\" years) proposal to provide preschool for all low and middle-income 4 year olds and to intelligently expand other services for our most vulnerable infants and toddlers. In a country where Head Start serves one in five income-eligible children almost half a century after its creation and Early Head Start serves roughly one in 20, the word \"all\" has an admittedly ambitious -- but awfully satisfying -- ring to it.\nAnd that's the news from just one of our 51 governments across the country. There are just too many red states to mention (but I will name Oklahoma, Georgia, Nebraska, and Mississippi) where there's just too much evidence assembling that elevating early childhood policy-making is not a partisan cause; it's a profoundly important one. With the national economy in recovery at last, and some state and federal policy stars aligning, perhaps we now actually can put our money where the brain science, child development science and the laws of economics have been telling us it belongs for more than a decade. May it prove a Happy New Year in the months to come, for the children and for all of us, followed by our abiding personal commitments until we all together -- finally and with overwhelming evidence -- can say, yes, there's a lot more light than there used to be.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T04:17:52Z\",\"url\":\"https://earlysuccess.org/blog/confidence-our-cause-yes-actually\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"I have been playing and buying roulette systems for many years and I am often asked for my personal recommendations regarding roulette systems. I get the same questions over and over: What is your honest opinion on whether or not any of the systems sold online are really worth it? If these systems really work, why are they wasting their time selling them for just a few dollars when they could be making more money using them?\nEVERYBODY wonders these things, and that is why I offer free ebook and reviewing popular roulette systems, their strategies and which ones don’t work. This information will save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, wasted on buying systems that just don’t deliver! Make sure you read to the END for my suprising discovery.\nStrategy: Casino Buster is basically a guessing game. What you're told to do is divide the table into the six lines, 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, etc. You then look at the last 8-10 numbers that showed and see what section they hit in and try to guess the next section to hit based on the pattern of the previous numbers. Too much guessing and most often times you guess WRONG.\nDoes it work? If you’re a good guesser.\nIs it easy to use? Not really, depending how smart you are.\nThis is a message to hopefully help some of you from wasting your hard earned money and time.\nIn mid July of 2000, I came across a site titled Ludomeccanica Roulette, a man named Alessandro Diodoro was selling many systems that seemed promising. I purchased the Epocals 5-8 for $1500 and tested it. It does not produce a profit in the long term, so I sent Mr. Diodoro a few of my tests showing him that his $1500 dollar system was not very good.\nHe in turn emailed me saying that he felt my needs and tested his Personal System. He told me that with his Personal System he would lose only 1 game every 300 to 400 games. He also said that he had only came to the 11th spin in the system once in all the years of testing it and had not ever reached the 12th spin. And this meant in reality he had not ever lost a single game with his Personal System. He said that this system would be a security to me. And by the way he described it, it would be. After making a deal with Alessandro and sending him the first payment for his Personal System, he sent to me the system and I began testing.\nMy tests were very poor so I thought that I had misunderstood how to use his system. Upon review Alessandro told me I was a liar. I am not a liar. And this system lost about 1 game every 30 to 40 games. Mr. Diodoro then told me that he had actually not sent to me his best Personal System, the one that loses only 1 game in every 300 to 400 games, he had NEVER lost with it, etc.... but he would once I had made all of my payments. To me it was alot of money that I owed Mr. Diodoro, and though he had deceived me by not sending the system he described, I told him I would finish paying him out of my weekly pay check. The original deal was that I was going to pay off the system very quickly, and the money I would use to pay him would come directly from winnings of his system.\nAlessandro remodified our deal and I only had to pay him a total of $3400. This was the original $1500 from the Epocals 5-8, my first payment of $900, and a last payment of $1000. With the Western Union charges it was $3630.82.\nAfter sending him my last payment of $1000, he sent his best Personal System. My tests showed that in 302 games, all spins from the Hamburg site, that this system he had never lost with, came to spin 11 three times. And lost 4 games. This equaled a $3900 loss. These tests also gave his system a very large benefit by not playing double games as outlined in his system because in the first 143 games, playing double games as the system said I could do I had one game to spin 11, one to spin 12, and 4 losses. While doing these tests Alessandro tried to sell me more of his unbeatable systems. I sent to him some spins to test on these new systems he was offering, but he told me if I sent him a million spins his systems would always win.\nSo I sent to Mr. Diodoro the tests on his best Personal System and asked for a full refund. This seemed like a reasonable request. He has been unwilling to refund my money and stopped answering my emails. Now it has come to my having to contact an attorney. Hopefully this will help inform you to the way Mr. Diodoro does business, and keep you from making the same mistakes I have in trusting him and wasting alot of time in the process.\nDoes it work? Obviously not and he will take your money and change his website and email address as he has done so many times before!\nStrategy: The site boasts about 4 main systems ranging from the old Barbi to the new U.K. Barbi. Most of the information on their CD is redundant and difficult to read, much like their website. Nevertheless, one of their main systems is what they call 10/9 single street system. All you do is put a bet on each one of 9-10 of the 12 streets, hence covering most of the table. Of course, the ONE time it hits in a street you’re not covering, you’re wiped out. The regular Barbi system calls for you to place two to three units on a combination of streets, lines and quads. There is no progression, so when it hits on a section your not covering there is no way to make up for your losses, so you’re only chance is to be right most of the time.\nIs it easy to use? Yeap.\nStrategy: This system calls for you to chart numbers as they show until you get a line (6 number combo) that has hit 3 times in one street and 1 time in an adjacent street. You begin by betting this line for a series/progression of up to 18 bets. The progression goes like this: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, and 20. If after the first group of 4 bets you’re line doesn’t hit, you change to the next line (6 number combo) that has shown for next series of bets and so on. Your bankroll using $5 units is $595 and although this system has a 98% win rate, when you do get a loss, due to the high bankroll, you will lose anything that you won up to that point and often more.\nDoes it work? Yes, it does most of the time. But again, that 2% of the time you do lose is enough to wipe out your bankroll. Bummer.\nIs it easy to use? If you don’t mind charting.\nStrategy: This system is based on the theory that: First, some numbers will come up more than others. Second, some areas of the wheel will run more than others. Third, numbers will form running patterns. It allows you to locate when the wheel is running in a particular area and determine from past and present results which numbers are the strongest. Then following a set of rules you narrow it down to generally playing one or two numbers three times.\n1. Consider the last number on the marquee (neon strip that gives the last eighteen numbers spun) and check two right and two left of that number. If these hot wheel numbers are three out of the last five spins you are ready to proceed.\n2. Compute each of these hot wheel numbers to see if it had been up an additional time within eighteen spins. If so you are ready to play the numbers qualifying for both rules. (Generally one or two numbers).\nSkip one spin and play the qualifying numbers three times or until you win. Wait for the next set of qualifiers.\nExample: last five spins are 29-11-24-25-10.\nLooks like three of five might be close so you check the last number which is 10.\nTwo right and left of ten are 25-29 and 27-00. Numbers 10-25 and 29 meet our requirements. In checking back on the marquee you find that number 25 has been up another time in the past 18 spins. After skipping one spin --- Play number 25 only for three times or until you win. After playing stop and wait for a new play.\nDoes it work? Yes, if you can wait long enough to make a play, memorize the wheel and afford the price of $1000 for the first four steps and $10,000 for all seven.The people who pay big money for the system and learn the wheel claim it works, but requires patience.\nIs it easy to use? It depends on what you consider easy. Of course, if you know the wheel perfectly, then you can do well. You are investing time in place of money. Very few learn the wheel perfectly, not to mention the long break even periods and the patience required before you get a play.\nStrategy: This method uses a chart to try and figure out which section of the wheel is hitting. It has a low bankroll requirement and wins about 85% of the time. But it is NOT mechanical. It takes quite a bit of practice and experience to get good at selecting the correct section. Although the chart gives you a good indication, but it is not an exact indicator.\nDoes it work? Yes, about 85% of the time, if you’re good.\nIs it easy to use? It is easy to use but not easy to learn.\nStrategy: After charting the wheel for about two hours, you play the first 12 numbers to hit 5 times each. You play these 12 numbers for a progression of up to 12 times, stopping when one of the numbers show.\nDoes it work? Yes it does, but you cannot play with $1 or $5 units because the bankroll would be way to large, nearly $2000 in fact.\nIs it easy to use? Yes and no. The strategy is simple but charting for two hours and playing 12 numbers for a progression of 12 is just too tedious. We still want to have fun.\nStrategy: This system plays a single dozen for a progression. It does work well except for that sometimes when playing live it goes to the 9th and 11th bets. And this strategy will not work online because it is not unusual for an online casino to skip a dozen 15-20 times with the maximum bet being $350. You would reach the maximum bet before your dozen ever hits.\nDoes it work? Yes, until it goes to the 11th bet and beyond. If you’re playing live and have a big enough bankroll, and don’t mind placing a $350 bet on a dozen, then this would work for you. If you plan to play online, this would eventually fail.\nIs it easy to use? Yes.\nStrategy: This system is based on betting on repeat numbers. It works like this, if the number 36 shows you start by placing one unit on 36. If the next number to show is 33, you place one unit on both numbers 36 and 33. If 12 now appears, you place one unit on each of 36, 33 and 12 and so on. After the 7th bet you put two units on each number and this goes on for up to 12 spins. The progression is 1 to 6 units for up to 12 spins. If one of your numbers hit you make a small profit and start over from the beginning. They also mention that you should wait until you have three repeats within 14 spins to start betting.\nDoes it work? Temporarily, but not as often as it should to produce a profit long-term. This is another one of those short-term win, long-term loss systems.\nDoes it work? No. In my testing, it went over the 5 bets on the very first try. Too much money risked for such a poor strategy.\nIs it easy to use? Sure, and easy to lose.\nStrategy: Here’s the basics: You always bet on TWO dozens at once. Those two dozens are the LAST TWO ones that just came out, as long as they are different. If they are not different, you don’t place a bet until you get a couple of dozens that are different. The progression: BEFORE you start your first bet, you write down the number 1. You'll bet 1 unit on each dozen (so 2 units total). When you win your first bet, you circle this number and that's also the amount you've won. If you lose your first bet, you'll add the number 1 twice (because you lost TWO units) to the right side of the first number 1, which gives you THREE numbers 1 in a row. The next bet will be THE SUM of the two OUTSIDE numbers, 1+1=2 on EACH of the dozens. If you win now, you’ll circle these two numbers (the left one and the right one) and you'll see that there is still one number left. You have to bet that one number on each dozen (so 2 units total). If you win this bet, all units are gone and you've concluded your one unit winning.\nDoes it work? In my testing, it only worked temporarily and would have losing streaks, like most systems of this kind.\nIs it easy to use? Has quite a few rules. Ease of use would be average.\nTo sum it all up, I have found that there are a few systems that work, but they had their drawbacks like needing a huge bankroll, charting for extended periods of time or being difficult to use. They include Don Young’s Infallible System, Power Roulette, Tom Utley System and even Roulette Secrets Revealed. I have found only one system that addresses all of these issues and yet STILL PRODUCES A PROFIT!\nIt's called the Goldmine Roulette System, and you can get more information by clicking here.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T12:21:04Z\",\"url\":\"http://roulette-systems.com/roulette-system-reviews.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"With the Dodgers 6-2 victory on Saturday night, Los Angeles baseball fans will have at least one more chance to go to the ballpark and forget about everything else, but not before watching their heroes battle against the Houston Astros in Game 5 of the 2017 Fall Classic. Despite playing at home, the Astros are the World Series Game 5 odds underdog, but there is a good reason for that, and his name is Clayton Kershaw. The series is tied at 2, which is why both teams will be looking to regain the advantage before going back to Hollywood, where a new King may be crowned next Tuesday. The Dodgers come into this one as -150 favorites, with the total set at 7. Let’s find out which team offers the best value for you to cash in.\nWhy consider the Dodgers World Series Game 5 Odds?\nWhy consider the Astros World Series Game 5 Odds?\nThe Astros meltdown in Game 4 is no reason to panic, at least not yet. Dallas Keuchel (2-2, 3.00 ERA) will be more than ready for his rematch against Kershaw, and during Game 3 and 4 the offense proved that they have what it takes to beat one of the best bullpens in all baseball. “That’s going to be a fun Game 5, just based on I faced this team five days ago. And we’ll see what kind of adjustments they make to me and what kind of adjustments I made to them,” the left-handed pitcher said earlier. Astros manager A.J. Hinch is pretty sure of his decision. “The elite pitchers, when they execute, you can see it over and over and still not hit it. So it comes down to execution and being able to adjust. Dallas, like a lot of great pitchers, will stay with his strengths until the other team proves otherwise. The key will be to harness the energy that comes with this building. He loves pitching at this place.” It’s clear they need a good offensive performance from players like Jose Altuve to back Keuchel’s effort, just as they did in Game 2, an instant classic for the ages.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T21:05:31Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/mlb/astros-host-dodgers-world-series-game-5-odds-underdog/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"New story that was supposed to be out in April but life’s been a little rough.\nDefinatly wanted to come back to this story though, so here it is!\nKinda just jumped right into it too.\nALSO! Check out my another angsty stories on my page!\nThis was the conversation two girls next to Hinata we’re having. However, he wasn’t paying any attention, as he was packing up his stuff and getting ready to leave for volleyball practice.\n“Yeah. Maybe he’ll be good looking too.” The two girls giggled.\nHinata got up to leave, but ended up running into one of the girls desk, knocking her things onto the floor.\n“Watch where you’re going, Hinata!” She cried out.\n“Sorry! I must’ve tripped! Here!” He said, helping her pick up her things.\n“Don’t touch my stuff! Just go! I’ll get it myself.” She huffed, and Hinata stood up, feeling bad that he knocked her things over, and was about to apologize again, when he bumped into somebody else standing behind him.\n“Is something the matter, ladies?” The person asked. He was quite tall and lanky, and had short, almost buzzed, black hair. He had some stubble on his chin, but not in a gross, pubescent way.\n“It’s nothing. It’s just Hinata here has two left feet and can’t even walk straight.” She grumbled out.\n“I’m really sorry!” Hinata apologized again, bowing to show he meant it. He didn’t mean to run into her desk, he was just in a hurry to get to practice. They were training more because of the tournament coming up, and he wanted to get some extra practice in before the others showed up.\n“Well that’s okay, accidents happen, here, let me help.” He man got down to help her and her friend pick up the items that were knocked off the desk.\n“I’m the new principal here. Mr.Endo” he held his hand out for the girl to shake and she blushed.\n“N-nice to meet you too.” She stuttered, and her friend was in awe at the gesture.\n“I wish, but we have class room cleaning duty today.” She whined.\n“Well, then.” The Mr.Endo looked back at Hinata and had a strange smirk on his face, that made Hinata feel sort of... uncomfortable. He was already anxious because he want to already be at the volleyball court practicing, and now he had to wait to see what Mr.Endo was going to say.\n“How about, since this gentleman- what is your name?” He asked.\n“I-I’m Hinata Shouyou..” He said.\n“Then I suggest you work fast.” He said in a strange tone.\n“In fact. Everyone!” He announced to the class.\nEveryone cheered and gathered their stuff, leaving instantly to go to their clubs or go home, leaving the four of them in the room.\n“Except for you of course. It’s only fair that since you knocked this lovely ladie’s things over, without helping her pick them up, you should kindly take her cleaning duty for today.” He said.\n“It doesn’t matter. What Mr.Endo says, goes.” The girl said, and her and her friend walked out of the room together.\n“Make you sure don’t miss any spots, Hinata.” The principal said, menacingly, and ruffled Hinatas hair, but not in a loving or playful way. More in a... sinister kind of way.\nOnce they left, Hinata was the only one standing in the room now, overly looking everything he had to clean, which usually took about ten people, he’d be cleaning by himself.\n“I could be practing right now!” Hinata grumbled, but set his bag down and got to work, knowing there would be no way out of it, no matter what he did.\nHinata had just finished sweeping under the desks and had pushed all the chairs in, when his teacher walked in.\n“Hinata? Why are you still here? Did everyone go home?” She asked.\n“No, it’s just me today.” He chuckled nervously, trying to finish as fast as he could.\n“Principal Endo sent everyone else home.” He said, trying to stay perky, but he just wanted to be finished already.\n“Why? Everyone who’s assigned to class room duty it supposed to be here.” She said, pulling out the chart.\n“Principals orders?” Hinata guessed. Everyone knew that if you were assigned class room duty, to stay, but Principal Endo’s orders were for everyone to leave. Hinata wasn’t even going to mention what happened earlier and why he was the only one left.\nHinata grimaced at the thought that he was the only one still cleaning and couldn’t make it to practice, because the principal made him stay and clean alone.\n“Oh..” was all he said, and finished sweeping silently, wallowing in his thoughts.\nHinata perked up at those words and turned to look at his teacher.\n“Thank you!” He said, quickly putting the broom away and grabbed his bag. He was so happy he could finally leave. His teacher was usually stingy with him, but he didn’t care. She let him leave so he could get some practice in today.\nHinata ran down the hallways in joy, but before he turned that final corner to get the gym, he once again, ran into Principal Endo.\n“Ah, I’m sorry.” He bowed, and was about to run past him, when his arm was grabbed.\n“You’re not supposed to run in the hallways, Hinata.” He said, in a dark tone, not quite like earlier. It was much more menacing this time.\n“Sorry. I was in a hurry.” He said, looking down at the ground. He suddenly felt the principal’s large, cold hand grab his chin and pull his face towards his line of sight.\nHinata was terrified. No one has ever said these kinds of things to him, nor handle him like this. The hand on his arm and face were the most uncomfortable feeling he’s ever felt. He didn’t dare look away, but he all he wanted to do was never look at this man ever again, and he had only met him a few hours ago.\n“Y-yes, sir.” Hinata said, getting a sick feeling in his stomach.\n“Good.” He smirked, and stood up straight, letting go of Hinatas face, but left his other hand around Hinatas arm.\n“You know.” He said suddenly, and loudly, causing Hinata to flinch.\nThat made Hinatas stomach sink. Him, Kageyama, Tanaka, and Nishinoya didn’t get the best grades in academics, but they were all important members of their team. If this new rule was set, none of them would be able to play unless they got really good grades. Which was a struggle for all of them, even when they did try their hardest.\nHinata didn’t like the way Principal Endo was refering to volleyball, but he kept his mouth shut and just wished the conversation would soon end.\n“Let me tell you something, Hinata Shouyou.” His voice got more gruff and quieter, as he clutched Hinatas arm harder and yanked him closer.\n“Yes sir.” Hinata said, in pain from the strong grip on his arm and dread for everything the principal was saying. Studying and focusing was hard, and if he failed, he wouldn’t get to be in his club anymore. Not only that, this principal was making Hinata feel extremely uncomfortable and warry of him. Was this what he was going to have to deal with all of high school.\n“Good.” He said, and went to let Hinata go, but tightened his grip once again.\n“Y-yes, sir.” Hinata stuttered once again in just a couple of minutes. He didn’t really understand what he meant though when he was talking about the girls, but he didn’t really want to know if it’d get in trouble for it.\n“Good. Now run along. And don’t tell anybody about this either. You’ll regret it if you do.” He said.\n“Have a lovely rest of your evening, Hinata Shouyou.” He smiled, and walked off, leaving Hinata feeling frightened and threatened by someone he barely knew and didn’t expect that of this person.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T06:13:50Z\",\"url\":\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14798895/chapters/34239048\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"There’s no truer cliché in today’s workplace than that the ancient Greek saying, “The only thing that is constant is change.” The business workplace has already undergone, and will continue to undergo, massive changes as younger generations of workers climb their way up the corporate ladder (or build their own ladder by starting their own companies). Whereas obtaining a work-life balance may have been the goal of employees over the past few decades, the line between professional and personal lives for Millennials is nearly invisible. Our work lives and our personal lives have essentially melded together.\nAs with any change, we have two options. We can either resist it, or we can embrace it. When it comes to Millennials, we’re opting for the latter. We are choosing the path of least resistance when it comes to keeping our personal lives entirely distinct from our professional lives. Instead of choosing to balance our work lives with our personal lives, we’ve opted to do what seems more natural, by integrating the two. So what does work-life integration actually look like for Millennials?\nToday, smart phones are the norm for every young business person in the workplace. Rather than waiting until 9:00 am to view our emails from our office computer, we’re happy to answer emails via phone over breakfast, or while on the treadmill, so that we get an early jump on the day. Whereas in the past, some might say that this early morning work is cutting into our “personal” time, as the youngest generation in the work place, we know that it may just save us an hour later, so we can enjoy a longer lunch later in the day.\nMillennials are definitely fortunate to work during a time when having a “cool” company culture is a top priority for most companies. Businesses across the board have recognized that happy employees are productive employees. As such, businesses are paying greater attention to detail to their office space – and making sure that it is a comfortable, positive, and inspiring environment for their team to spend so much of every day. Offices today feel far less sterile than those of years past. In lieu of a paltry vending machine and low lit break room, companies now have full kitchens, and in many times a game room, or breakout room where employees can spend time together, and ostensibly strengthen the bonds of the team.\nInnovation in office design really does make our offices feel like our homes away from home, and our colleagues feel like friends and family. Full disclosure: I do happen to work with my family, and my boyfriend, and my four-pound dog, Riley, so for me this rings true tenfold. But for Millennials as a whole, these days it feels like we’re at home at home, and we feel at home at work too.\nOther examples of how businesses are going to great lengths to make their company culture attractive can be seen in the growing number of on-site child care opportunities, or even “kid’s corners” popping up at companies, such as in Ivanka Trump’s office. Other companies encourage employees to bring their dogs to work. Sir Richard Branson recently made a huge splash in the press by saying that his employees can take as many vacation days as they want, as long as their work is up to par. These very public examples are driving even small, private companies to create strong cultures for their employees as well.\nOne of the other reasons that Millennials have been able to integrate their work and personal lives is due to the emergence of “all-in-one” campuses or office spaces. With office design expanding to incorporate not just the actual work space, but community spaces within the office (i.e. gourmet kitchens, gyms, TV rooms, putting greens), we’ve been able to blend our professional lives with our personal hobbies and daily functions.\nSome of the largest employers of young workers, such as Google and Facebook, have campuses with amenities coffee shops and even full restaurants right on their grounds. They offer in house massages, or have Thai food delivered once a week. Other companies are choosing to move their offices to urban areas within convenient walking distance to stores and restaurants, rather than renewing leases in the suburbs where there are less accessible amenities.\nIt’s clear that for Millennials, the idea that work should be separate from your “life” just doesn’t resonate. Work is a huge part of our lives. It’s one cog in the proverbial wheel. We’ve grown up with the entire world accessible at our fingertips, and we’re comfortable with it. We’re used to getting emails way past normal business hours. We enjoy being able to get ahead for the next day by working a bit from our home or our phone before the official start of the business day. We like the flexibility we have, because to us, work isn’t just something we do, work is a major part of our overall lifestyle. It helps define us. And we’re grateful that we have the opportunity to be able to integrate our work in our personal lives. In fact, we really wouldn’t have it any other way.\nStar Hughes is a director at Hughes Marino, Southern California’s leading commercial real estate firm that ...\tRead more articles from Star on Thought Catalog.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-22T12:56:00Z\",\"url\":\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/star-hughes/2015/02/millennials-dont-balance-work-and-their-personal-lives-they-combine-them/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"I have observed the similar situation couple of times in the past one year. Everything is normal from event viewer, server component state, service status, database copy health but the database activation will fail every time when I try to activate it from one of the nodes in 4 node DAG cluster. The databases are easy to do all possible operations in other 3 nodes, but one node. The issue occurs after a reboot, but will not resolve even if we wait for so longer or do another round of reboot.\nTry to move the PAM to different healthy node available in the DAG (not to the activation failed server), and try to repeat the operations. When you only have 2 node DAG, you may have no choice other than trying other possible solutions as we mentioned earlier this post. However, it is worth checking if you have more than one IP assigned to the DAG members in the production network range.\nOnce you confirm that the PAM role is currently hold by another healthy node, try to mount/activate database on server where we observed issues. It should just work fine!\nAdditional Info: I found this when we use more than one IP Address assigned a single network card on Exchange for relay/HA purposes. If we reassign the IPs to other nodes of the cluster, a communication gap between PAM and the node can occur. But, there are no harm in moving the PAM before you take major steps to make the cluster communication restored.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T04:41:09Z\",\"url\":\"http://exchangedictionary.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=date&year=2018&month=8\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"I&#39m ready to guess you almost certainly have not listened to the phrase &#39phytochemicals&#39 prior to. But you&#39ve been taking in them your entire existence and they are vitally essential to your existence and nicely-remaining. They are a single of the keys to true well being.\nSo, what are they? Phytochemicals are biologically lively substances in food stuff. They have well being boosting talents and probably healing talents. They selection in the hundreds in most plant food items. They are uncovered in fruits, veggies, legumes and grains.\nPhytochemicals operate jointly with vitamins and minerals to encourage well being and avert ailment. When you consume some broccoli or a tomato, you get all of these phytochemicals. So, can not you just consider a nutritional supplement? You could, but very first of all, researchers have isolated only a couple of the phytochemicals in food items. But These operate finest in mixture, so using just a single, isolated phytochemical is not any where around as efficient.\nFor instance, enable&#39s search at lycopene. It is uncovered in tomatoes and is an antioxidant. Anti-oxidants are a significant and essential issue, but for now, enable&#39s just simplify and say that anti-oxidants assistance to restore mobile hurt.\nResearchers did research and uncovered that tomatoes experienced a visible influence in opposition to prostate most cancers. They analyzed the tomato and isolated lycopene. Then the researchers did much more research, making use of lycopene. The influence on prostate most cancers was significantly much less. Does this indicate that lycopene does not operate?\nNo, it signifies that it functions finest in mixture with all the other phytochemicals in tomatoes, and the vitamins and minerals. You do not get that from a chemically similar, but lab-made, lycopene.\nIngesting a emblem is great for you, of training course. But taking in all the tomatoes you would want to get what you want from them would be pretty a process. So, a entire food items powder that I use, Berry Greens, gives freeze dried tomatoes, in a sort that retains the vitamins and minerals. And a entire good deal of other veggies and fruits as nicely. You get all the advantages of taking in all all those fruits and veggies, with no owning to eat all that food stuff.\nMost food items have not been analyzed and even all those that have been, researchers have only been ready to isolate a couple of the phytochemicals. Most veggies have hundreds of phytochemicals, and it&#39s not possible they will all be isolated, analyzed and recognized any time quickly. We do know now, however, that they do operate jointly to supply true well being for us.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T06:02:40Z\",\"url\":\"https://healthyfruitandvegetables.com/fruits-and-vegetables-and-phytochemicals/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Hollis is one of the more minor LIRR stations within Queens and has a very simple yet unusual design. It is located on the Main Line, which is on an embankment at this point. The station is less than a mile away from the Hillside Facility, a LIRR maintenance facility that has its own employee's only train stop. It would seem sensible to replace the stop with a public entrance to the Hillside Facility from the street to provide more frequent service to both stations. The electric trains in the yard at Hillside are clearly visible from Hollis platform. The station, although on the Main Line, can be considered part of the Hempstead branch for service since every train that stops in the station except for one westbound in the AM peak (the special electric local from East Williston) originates or terminates in Hempstead. The stop has two side platforms on either side of the four-track main line. There is a secondary yard lead that passes the Hempstead-bound platform (beyond its simple fence) as a fifth track that doesn't platform is electrified. Both side platforms are made out of wood, only four cars can platform, and for shelter each has an old large silver shelter area with the Manhattan-bound platform hosting the station's only TVMs. The main way to access the platform is via a pedestrian tunnel beneath the tracks that connects two disjointed sections of 193 Street the northside access is at a dead end, southside is along 99 Avenue's sidewalk. It has a single staircase up to each platform. The New York-bound platform is also connected to a now fenced off roadway that runs up to the platform that is a dead end of Sagamore Avenue. A fence to the west of the station prevents cars today using the street for a through route but pedestrians can also access the station from the end of 191 Street. This roadway was originally used by LIRR maintenance personnel and for drop-offs until the late 1980s (recollection of Keith Viverette) when it was closed.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T19:00:36Z\",\"url\":\"http://subwaynut.com/lirr/hollis/index.php\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Of course, now he's gone to The Great Theatrical Costumier in the Sky, hopefully some of the good things Gary did will start to come out and give a better understanding to us of this brilliant but confused individual. Like his work with under privileged kids, for instance. And I'm sure anyone who shared his passion for the boy scout movement will agree that his contribution in that direction was beyond reproach. Anyone fortunate enough to have seen him decked out infull Akela regalia, dibbing his dib and dobbing his dob will be smiling at the very thought, no doubt. I certainly never knew you could have so much fun practicing a sheep shank with a willing sixer and a bottle of baby oil.\nObviously, Gary and I knew each other from way back - well before he began to take an active interest in paedophilia. Well, he was too *young* back then! I'll never forget bumping into him at the schoool gates - this was when I was still at Secondary Modern back in Bromley, moonlighting on Saxophone with the Kon-Rads after lessons at the local Espresso Bongo joint in the evenings. He was still known to us all as Paul Gadd back then and hadn't had a hit of any sort at thgis stage. Hardly surprising really, as he was still working full time as a Lollipop Man at the time. But I did sneak off school ocassionally to watch him on stage doing a lunchtime show or two and it was all there in embryonic form; the pout, the preening dandyish grandeur and the repulsive;y sweaty body hair. And who could forget his immortal catchphrase, even back then? \"DON'T TELL THE SOCIAL SERVICES!!\" He'd yell, before bounding off the stage waving and smiling with an insincerity that was incredibly moving to us kicks-starved teenyboppers.\nFor a young, aspiring pop minstrel keen to get a winklepickered foot onto the first rung of the ladder of pop stardom, there are worse ways to spend an evening than learning to gyrate saucily in a spangly silver suit wearing a badly disguised chest wig, singing nonsensical lyrics about gang bangs into the bedroom mirror. And I should know - I spent several days with Alvin Stardust (or Shane Fenton as he was known back then) trying to dislodge a cheap fairground ring from a leather gloved finger. He might have been a Coo-c-choo on stage, but he was a hapless git with the digital dexterity of an all-in-wrestler when it came to ring-removal.

{"text":"The Calgary Flames will look to pull off the huge upset at the NHL Betting Odds against the Las Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday night when the two Stanley Cup hopefuls meet in Sin City in what looks like an intriguing contest just waiting to happen. If you’re looking to find out where the value in this mid-week NHL betting matchup lies, then let’s find out right now!\nWhen: Wednesday, February 21, 10:30 p.m.\nWhy Consider Betting on Calgary?\nWhy should you consider betting on the Flames in this Wednesday night matchup? Because Calgary is a little bit desperate, plus they’ve scored three goals or more in each of their last five wins while going 5-5 over their last 10. The Flames have lost two straight coming into this contest including a heartbreaking 2-1 overtime loss to Boston on Monday. After defenseman TJ Brodie turned the puck over deep in the Flames end Boston’s Brad Marchand got free on a breakaway and ended it by slipping the puck through the pads of rookie goaltender David Rittich. “Tonight was on me,” the Calgary Brodie said. “Yes, I tried to pass to Johnny (Gaudreau). I could have passed it to (Sean Monahan) I could have shot it. It’s one of those things that looking back now, I definitely could have done something different.” The good news is that Calgary has also won four straight and nine of their last 12 on the road. The bad news is that Calgary has been awful on Wednesday nights, going a nearly winless 1-5 in their last six Wednesday games.\nWhy Consider Betting On Vegas?\nWhy consider betting on Vegas in this affair? Because the Knights have been absolutely phenomenal on their home-ice this season and will be very focused following their last contest. The Knights have gone 22-5-2 at home this season, but they’re coming off a sluggish 2-0 home loss against Anaheim on Monday despite out-shooting the Ducks 33-20. Vegas was without forwards Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and James Neal. “He’s a big part of our line, for sure. We know what we want to do out there,” forward David Perron said of Neal. “We do a lot of little plays, like possession plays, and it’s tough for Tuchy to come in and kind of get in that. Maybe he has a different mentality. He hasn’t really played that way this year — he’s more of a speed guy. I felt we got better throughout the game. We had some chances.” Vegas had won its three previous games, all at home and will now look to get back in the win column at home.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T23:01:22Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/nhl/betting-odds-preview-flames-golden-knights/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"French 75: gin, lemon, Lillet rose, sugar, peach bitters, prosecco.\nIt was my first time at Corner Door, which just opened in June next to A-Frame and Waterloo & City in Culver City, and yet the bartender made me a French 75. I looked at him sideways, sorta disappointed that he decided to lead with that at this hosted tasting. Why not show off with something original from the specialty cocktail section of the menu? But he assured me that this French 75 was a little different.\nSure enough, instead of the ho-hum champagne cocktail I expected, it came across as a gin cocktail. Nice! The dryness of the prosecco came through but the bubbles were diluted with gin and Lillet Rose. Not a bad thing. The peach bitters finished things off in a subtle summery way. Well, this was promising.\nOf course, I figured I couldn’t go wrong with the cocktails at Corner Door seeing as how Beau Du Bois, the bar’s mixmaster, had done some impressive stuff for MB Post in Manhattan Beach when he was there. And here, he had effectively added to my dream Westside cocktail bar hop route connecting Culver City to Venice, from Oldfield’s to A-Frame to Sunny Spot and Tasting Kitchen. Yayy!\nCorner Door’s cocktail menu is divided into two categories of Classics with Palomas and Old Fashioneds and “Originals.” But the originals are classically inspired with a short list of simple ingredients and a dash of edginess thrown in. For the current menu, which is their opening menu, there are turns on the Monkey Gland and Penicillin which will leave you pleasantly surprised, seeing the direction Beau took those cocktails in. By the way, you gotta love the names he comes up for these.\nA new fall menu is planned for September so you have til then to try these out for yourself. Here are the Originals cocktails along with some tasting notes.\nMezcallin: mezcal, ginger, lemon, pineapple gomme.\nMiner Incident: bourbon, apricot, lemon, honey, Thai chili.\nMiner Incident: You gotta be careful with this spicy take on a Gold Rush as it can easily get out of hand so ask the bartender to take it easy on the chili unless you want to taste nothing but heat. For me the spice overwhelms the flavors in the cocktail. Where’s the apricot, lemon and honey? Oh, I can’t taste anything other than the burning burning burning. When they redid the cocktail, though, with less spice, the pepper still comes through but only on the back end and the bourbon pops up midpalate. I thought it was just OK but apparently it’s one of the more popular cocktails off the list.\nFortune & Glory: gin, orange, cantaloupe, absinthe, orgeat.\nFortune & Glory: Mellow warm flavors of cantaloupe and orgeat. Almost like a melony orange and cream soda, if that makes sense. Inspired by the 1920’s classic Monkey Gland cocktail, Beau decided to substitute orgeat for the grenadine, which usually tends to be heavy and create an unsavory brown color when mixed with the orange juice in the original cocktail. Nice way to start off the evening or end a meal.\nDutch Prison: arrack, curaçao, lemon cordial, peach, black tea, cinnamon.\nDutch Prison: Multi-layered and complex. You can taste the lemon, peach and cinnamon up front all complementing that black tea. Oddly enough though, it reminds me of an apple cider.\nHeads-up: For the happy hour, which is Monday through Thursday 5:30-7pm, fortify your stomach for the night of drinking ahead with the grilled cheese sandwich. Surprisingly more substantial than you’d expect of an HH dish and oh-so delicious with its thick bread and apricot jam!\nI’m with you there. Wouldn’t mind a little fortune and glory myself, either of them, right about now.\nCool to see Beau running a bar program in Culver. I met him at Andaz and enjoyed his cocktails at what was initially an ambitious restaurant and bar.\nFood GPS, Did you visit Beau when he was at MB Post? Loved his cocktails there, too.\nThat’s pretty funny… I’ve never sent back a cocktail in my life, but had to have my Miner Incident remade. SO HOT! It made me wonder if he rubs the rim of the glass with the cut chili.\nZach, Riiight? I’m surprised when they straw test it that they still send it out.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T13:28:24Z\",\"url\":\"https://carolineoncrack.com/2012/08/13/corner-door-cocktails-culver-city/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"If you got a group of economists in a room in 2013, and asked them if they had to name one factor- just one, as to what brought down the world economy in 2008, there might be quite a few diverse answers to the question. Many of those in the room might say that out of control speculation, in stocks and other investments had caused the devastating economic collapse when the economic bubble burst. This could certainly be justified when describing the tech bubble that burst just before 9/11. Others would say that it was 9/11 itself, with the accompanying deflation of consumer confidence- not to mention, right after the terror attacks, a basic fear of gathering in public places, such as shopping malls.\nBut I’d be willing to bet that the number one cause of the economic debacle that started in the last decade would be attributable to the mortgage meltdown. It was bad mortgages that brought down Lehman Brothers to a great extent, and put insurance giant AIG on the ropes due to the large stake they had in insuring mortgages. And of course there was the tremendous collapse in real estate values. As the U.S. went, so went the rest of the industrialized world, as many foreign investors has placed their money in what seemed like a rock solid investment- U.S. mortgage-backed securities.\nTo take this line of thinking to an even more micro level, it is widely felt by many economist and analysts that what brought down the mortgage market was fraud. There was fraud in the fact that many who applied for a mortgage made up their financial profiles out of mid air. It’s hard to believe now, but as late as 2008, an individual or a couple could finance a home purchase strictly by stating their income, their liquid assets, and put next to nothing down with a credit score as low as 580! This is thought of a preposterous today, but until the middle of 2008 it was a common occurrence. And by the way, the mortgages that were obtained with these types of fantasy financials might very well have allowed for a balance that rapidly increased and/or monthly payments that could quadruple in a single month under the perfect storm of circumstances.\nIt’s seems harsh today to blame to near collapse of world markets solely on the U.S. mortgage industry, but bad mortgage loans made on fraudulent information certainly played a major; if not the major, role in the economic meltdown.\nMortgage lenders have learned plenty from their mistakes, however. In 2013, it is virtually impossible to obtain a mortgage loan without documenting the borrowers’ financial profile every which way from Sunday. It might even be said that in today’s environment, lenders are overbearing on their insistence for documentation on the part of those who would like to borrower money. Overbearing it may be, but in light of the aftermath of the mortgage-induced economic crisis that still affects us today, it is also understandable.\nThere is really no room for fraud in today’s mortgage market. I’m not just talking in a legal sense here, but also from an auditing sense as well. There are so many checks and cross-checks in mortgage lending today, that fraud is next to impossible to pull off.\nLet’s take income verification for an example. Whereas pre-2008 a borrower could state their income and have the lender believe whatever they were told, today a borrower must present their income taxes for the last 2 years, and these taxes are audited between the lender and the IRS. The buyer must sign a form called the 4506-T, which allows the IRS to provide transcripts of the borrowers’ 1040’s. The numbers on transcripts must match what is on the 1040’s supplied to the lender, or there is no deal. Even if the transcribed tax returns would otherwise qualify the borrower, the fact that they don’t match the 1040’s presumes that there has been an attempt at fraud and the borrower will have no recourse with the lender. In the case where taxes were amended, most lenders will not accept a 1040-X if it was filed after the initial loan application; and furthermore, the IRS will not usually verify amended returns for the lender for 6 to 12 weeks after they are filed. And of course, increasing the income on an amended return will almost always increase the tax liability to the tax payer. Let’s just say that filing an amended return in the midst of applying for a mortgage loan is, well… messy!\nThen there’s the question of assets. A lender will want to verify that the borrower actually has the money that they need to close a real estate transaction, and there are some sources of funds that are not acceptable to most lenders. If a buyer’s bank statement indicates a deposit that cannot be linked to his payroll that deposit will have to be explained and sourced. Maybe the large deposit was a tax refund. In the rare instance that the refund is not direct deposited (in which the bank statement would indicate that it was derived from the U.S. Treasury), then a copy of the tax refund check would have to be displayed to the lender. Deposits that derive from strictly cash for the most part must be discounted; that is, removed from the total of acceptably certified funds. For instance if a borrower shows $15,000 in a bank account, but $5,000 can be explained only as a cash deposit, the borrower generally gets credit for only $10,000. If the extra $5,000 is needed to close the real estate transaction, then it must be gotten from another acceptable source. In many cases this can be a gift from a family member. But even then, the donor must fill out a gift letter and supply his bank statement to show an ability to provide the gift. This can be a severe nuisance, especially to the donor. But it also guards to some extent against money laundering; that is, having the borrower supply non-sourced funds to the donor only to be given back to the buyer in the form of a gift. It’s not going to happen!\nIn regards to appraisals, those who originate loans, and those staff people who support them, cannot order appraisals. In the old days, pre-2008, a loan officer could call up his favorite appraiser and ask him to appraise a property and to hit a certain value. Most appraisers were honest, but there were a few here and there that, out of fear of not getting future business from the loan originator, would massage a number to make it come out just right. These days an appraisal must be ordered by someone within the mortgage company that will not benefit based on whether or not the appraisal comes in at value. Appraisers are usually picked in rotation from a panel or gotten from appraisal agencies that work with the lender. And in most companies, loan originators are not allowed to have any salient conversations with the appraiser as to property value. In the case of a purchase, the appraiser will obtain a copy of the buyer/seller contract, but influence on the part of the originating party is severely reduced or even prohibited.\nAnother important aspect of mortgage fraud prevention that was not around in force a few years back are Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems reports; otherwise known as MERS reports. These reports are particularly adept at finding other properties that may be owned by the borrowers but were not reported on the loan application. This would apply to properties that are free and clear- even out of state vacant land. If other properties are revealed in the report, they must be accounted for by the buyer and taken into consideration in regards to the borrower’s qualifications.\nIt’s simply amazing that there are still those who attempt to pull off mortgage fraud. Every month, many of us in the mortgage business received electronic newsletters from a couple of prominent real estate law firms that tell us who has just been indicted for mortgage fraud throughout the U.S. and its territories. How anyone thinks that can get away with this is beyond me. All the time, in these newsletters, we hear of people going to prison for 10 to 20 years or more, and being fined 100’s of thousands of dollars for being implicit in mortgage fraud. Sometimes I think that the perpetrators’ prison sentences should be doubled just for the stupidity that they demonstrate!\nI’ve heard from many people, and sometimes feel myself, that mortgage lenders are a bit overbearing in their zealousness to stop mortgage fraud. I’m mean; let’s face it, just because person deposits cash into their checking account doesn’t mean that they’re trying to pull of the crime of the century! But as I’ve said many times before, the key to getting though that gauntlet that is very often a part of obtaining a mortgage loan in just knowing that rules that are in play. This is where an experienced mortgage professional can be invaluable to prospective borrowers. The housing market is way up, in California at least. So there are an awful lot of folks who are succeeding in financing home purchases. It can be done with a professional team comprised of a knowledgeable lender and experienced Realtor®. There are plenty of examples out there.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T10:46:57Z\",\"url\":\"http://www.sunstarmortgage.com/loanOptions/Brian's%20Blog/The%20Efforts%20to%20Deter%20Mortgage%20Loan%20Fraud/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"1. You obsess over things that don’t even register in other people’s heads.\nOCD doesn’t necessarily mean that you walk into a room and flip a light switch on and off multiple times. The “obsessive” part is what surfaces most often. You obsess over bad news. Some tiny part of an anecdote that comes up in conversation (that everyone else took as a passing detail) will stay with you for days after you hear it. Things you see on the news will keep you up long after the person lying beside you has drifted off to sleep. Your mind is constantly going over details that put you on edge, and you are often trying to will yourself to press pause on the relentless replays.\n2. You are incredibly particular.\nAnd when people meet you, they assume you’re a huge perfectionist. You are incredibly aware of symmetry, alignment, and are generally very diligent about keeping things in a specific place. You are the type of person who pays attention to minute details that other people don’t notice.\n3. When you’re around people, they often don’t realize that you’re trying incredibly hard to keep your mental illness out of the picture.\nOCD is something that can be kept under wraps in that you can be flooded with obsessive panic while still sitting across from your friends, smiling and nodding at the story they’re telling. Many people with OCD have small habits that only kick in when they’re reacting to something that makes them feel anxious and panicked. While sitting across from you, they could be pulling at their hair, wringing their hands or even counting down from 10 just to keep themselves calm. And you’d never notice.\n4. You gravitate toward tasks that fully consume you. It’s intentional.\n5. You are overly practical, even when talking about your biggest fears.\nAt most points during the day, when you’re removed from trigger situations, you are able to discern your OCD-like behaviors and can even explain to yourself that what you’re obsessing over is irrational. You crave practicality because it is concrete. When you can pinpoint the irrationality in your obsessive thoughts, it makes you feel more in control.\n6. You have an aversion to clutter, and are very distracted by your surroundings.\nDepending on what sets off your compulsive nature, you might not be able to work in a messy environment, or you might get extremely stressed standing in crowds. For some, sensory overload can push people into fits of anxiety — loud or sharp noises can also be what sets you off. What your friends don’t realize is that whatever is making you “seem irritable” is actually causing you severe stress. You often find yourself in situations where you need to make an excuse to leave or make a quick exit because it’s too complicated to explain that something triggered your OCD and that you needed to remove yourself before your reaction elevated.\n7. Just like physical clutter can bother you, digital, emotional or mental clutter can bother you, too.\nHaving ten tabs open on one browser drives you crazy, as does seeing an incredibly messy desktop. Similarly, if you have too many things bouncing around in your head it will completely overwhelm you, and you’ll need to write down some of the thoughts just to give yourself some relief. Even emotional clutter can flare up your OCD because it’s providing yet another concern for you to obsess over.\nYour obsessiveness is at your worst because you can realize that you’re thinking irrationally, but you cannot stop yourself. You often visualize bad things happening, and then need a visual distraction just to push the mental images out of your head.\n9. You need to write all of your to dos — work to dos and life to dos — down in a notebook.\nWhen you have OCD, you keep your fears in the forefront of your mind when you’re going through an obsessive period. This leaves you worried that everything else that should be on your mind will slip through the cracks. In short, OCD can make you forgetful because you can’t focus on your jarring obsessions and your real life all at the same time. You are constantly writing down things to do, texting yourself reminders, and leaving notes for yourself just to make sure you’re covered.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T13:53:22Z\",\"url\":\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/maya-kachroo-levine/2016/01/9-things-people-dont-realize-youre-doing-because-of-your-ocd/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

The trend could be reversed as a result of changes in federal laws.\nThe costs of installing solar energy systems dropped from $10.50 per watt in 1998 to $7.60 per watt in 2007, according to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study released Thursday.\nThose declines amount to an average of 30 cents per watt, or 3.5 percent, per year. The costs remained relatively flat in 2006 and 2007, however. The calculations, based on 2007 dollars, didn't include any cash rebates or tax credits.\nThe researchers, Ryan Wiser, Galen Barbose and Carla Peterman, pored over data from 37,000 grid-connected solar-panel systems in 12 states. Arizona takes the prize for having the lowest cost for systems with less than 10 kilowatts in capacity, followed by California and New Jersey, according to the study, \"Tracking the Sun: The Installed Cost of Photovoltaics in the U.S. From 1998–2007.\"\nPanel prices played a minor part in causing the cost declines. Instead, the cost of labor, inverters, marketing, among others, contributed to cheaper installations, the study showed. The researchers calculated the non-module costs and found that they slid from $5.7 per watt in 1998 to $3.6 per watt in 2007.\n\"This suggests that state and local PV deployment programs – which likely have a greater impact on non-module costs than on module prices – have been at least somewhat successful in spurring cost reductions,\" according to the report.\nStates with strong incentive programs also tend to have more companies competing for providing installation and other services. Arizona, California and New Jersey are among states that offer more generous tax and cash incentives. In fact, New Jersey's program was so popular that the state ended almost the entire rebate program last year (see Budget Shortfalls Could Shrink States' Solar Incentives).\nThe Berkeley Lab researchers examined the average costs of installing systems that are less than 10 kilowatts in 2006 and 2007, and found that Arizona enjoyed the lowest cost, at $7.60 per watt, while California offered $8.10 per watt. New Jersey came in third at $8.40 per watt. Maryland's systems cost the most: $10.60 per watt.\nLooking at data for those sub-10-kilowatt installations in 2006 and 2007, the researchers also found that systems that use thin-film panels cost on average $0.5 per watt more than those using crystalline silicon panels. The difference wasn't as great for systems larger than 10 kilowatts.\nA residential system costs less to install if it comes with a new home, the study said. In fact, it cost $0.60 per watt less than similar-sized system in an existing home, the researchers found when they compared those installations in California in 2006 and 2007.\nState and federal incentives, along with those offered by some utilities, have been instrumental in making solar energy systems more affordable to homeowners and business. The researchers found that cash incentives have fallen while other types of lures have become more lucrative, including the federal investment tax credit (ITC).\nMore incentives became available to commercial installations in 2006 thanks to a change in ITC. Counting all the cash and tax incentives – and factoring the taxes on those cash incentives – the researchers figured that the total after-tax incentives for a commercial system was $3.90 per watt in 2007, the highest during the 10-year period.\nIn contrast, after-tax incentives for residential installations reached an average of $3.1 per watt in 2007, the lowest since 2001. This trend could reverse as a result of a change to the ITC this year that lifted a cap for residential installations, making the tax credit comparable to the one for commercial projects.\nOverall, the net cost of installing a residential system (after factoring all available private, state and federal incentives) reached an average of $5.1 per watt in 2007, roughly 7 percent below the 2001 levels, the study showed. The net cost for a commercial system averaged $3.9 per watt in 2007, which is 32 percent below the 2001 levels.\nThe researchers said although costs for all types of systems remained flat between 2005 and 2007, they could fall dramatically in the coming years. Solar industry executives and analysts have predicted a decline of five to more than 20 percent in panel prices this year. Plus, the $787 billion economic stimulus package signed by President Obama this week also could significantly boost the solar market demand in the United States over the next few years.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T18:27:40Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-solar-installed-costs-fell-nearly-28-over-a-decade-5761\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"While the poor dream of having riches, the wealthy long for simplicity.\nIf there’s one thing you can count on (besides death and taxes), it’s the desire to “get rich quick.” Why do you think lottery fever shows no sign of cooling off? Millions of people buy lottery tickets for no other reason than to instantly acquire unimaginable riches.\nWhat a hopeless illusion! Nevermind that you have a greater chance of getting struck by lighting while standing on your head in a bowl of corn flakes than winning the lottery. Quick riches never did anyone any good. They certainly never brought anyone happiness.\nWe’ve never been rich, so how do we know that? Simple. We’ve never heard anyone say, “I’m rich, and I’m finally happy.” Instead, we’ve heard stuff like, “Wealth is a burden,” or “I wish my life were a lot simpler.” The truth is, wealth can do a lot (both good and bad), but it inevitably complicates your life. There’s nothing wrong with wealth (and neither is there any dishonor in proverty). What matters is your contentment with what you have.\nPosted on June 4, 2013, in Daily Devotionals.

{"text":"If you’ve watched ‘Charmed’ or ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’, you’ve likely seen the multi-talented Shannen Doherty’s work on screen. This certainly isn’t the only thing the celebrity has worked on, however. Doherty has had parts in an incredible number of films and shows, including the original ‘21 Jump Street’, ‘Magnum P.I.’, ‘Little House on the Prairie’ and even a performance as a competitor for ‘Dancing with the Stars’. Throughout her career, Doherty acts, writes, directs, and produces, and showcasing a broad scope of her talents.\nDoherty now fights one of the most intense battles possible in her life: the fight against breast cancer. Doherty was diagnosed in early 2015, and has powerfully continued the fight well into 2016. Doherty has now shaved her head in a continued effort to fight against the disease, and remains positive and active throughout her battle.\nDoherty’s fight is one that many face, and being a famous actress does not exempt her. Doherty fights not only with the support of many close to her, but with many thousands of fans supporting her and cheering her along the way. Doherty stands as an inspiration to many, and an unfortunate reminder that this fight is happening all the time for too many in the world.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T14:19:08Z\",\"url\":\"http://showbiz-celebrity.com/celebrity/shannen-doherty-fights-breast-cancer.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Tim Gunn, the beloved mentor on Project Runway, is branching out in all sorts of new directions in 2012. Most notably, everyone's favorite filter-less and erudite fashion mentor has landed another TV spot co-hosting a new daytime talk show, The Revolution, which airs January 16 at 2pm EST on ABC. Each week the health and lifestyle show will feature one woman's five-month-long weight loss \"journey\" to change, compressed into five days; Friday will be the \"reveal\" day. (This is a great concept--who doesn't love a good make-over reveal?) Tim's role on the show will be to provide fashion and styling advice to these women whose bodies are undergoing big changes. He'll be joined in co-hosting duties by the often-frenetic Ty Pennington (interior design/art), Harley Pasternak (trainer and nutritionist to every hot celeb out there), Dr. Jennifer Ashton (OB/Gyn/women's health issues), and Dr. Tiffanie Davis Henry (relationship expert). While somewhat under the radar, Tim also signed on as Weight Watchers' \"style consultant\" last January.\nTim Gunn, the beloved mentor on Project Runway, is branching out in all sorts of new directions in 2012.\nTim&apos;s role on the show will be to provide fashion and styling advice to these women whose bodies are undergoing big changes.

Sure, we will push the buttons in terms of a reality wake-up call, but we&apos;re not mean-spirited. You&apos;ll never see us talking behind someone&apos;s back in snarky, unsupportive way.\"\nOn \"aspirational\" dressing when you&apos;re trying to lose weight: \"I didn&apos;t believe in aspirational clothes before this. I was always of the belief, &apos;Let&apos;s fit the size you are now. Let&apos;s not talk about being four sizes smaller.&apos; But there is the health issue. So now we&apos;re talking speculatively yet carefully considering where their body and shape will be. So we&apos;re asking, &apos;What will she be in four months? In five months?&apos; That was the biggest fashion challenge. They get a goal outfit on Monday!\"\nOn plus size designers: \"It&apos;s so difficult. Have you seen most of the plus-size sections out there? It&apos;s horrifying. Whoever&apos;s designing for plus-size doesn&apos;t get it. The entire garment needs to be reconceived. You can&apos;t just take a size 8 and make it larger. In my travels, I&apos;ve been an advocate for larger women. I&apos;ve been talking to designers, but only a half-dozen make an effort. Most say, &apos;I don&apos;t want a woman who&apos;s a size 10 or 11 wearing my clothes.&apos; Well, shame on you! It&apos;s not realistic. We need to address real women with real needs. At Parsons, we had fit models that ranged in size from 2 to 10. We&apos;ve got to reconceive clothes for all sizes.\"\nOn his own design ambitions: \"Sometimes I say, &apos;I&apos;m going to do a clothing line!&apos; I&apos;d love nothing more to respond to those designers who refuse to address it. I&apos;m seriously considering [designing]! Just because I want to be a part of the solution. I&apos;m so tired of giving them so few options. I end up always saying, &apos;I&apos;m taking you to Lane Bryant because at least they understand you.&apos; But there&apos;s a stigma.\"\nThanks to Project Runway, Tim Gunn kind of feels like the fashion industry's favorite uncle: Incredibly kind, not afraid to be honest with you when you need it, a cheerleader in the workroom with his famous catchphrase, \"Make it work.\" But even Gunn knows that it's hard to \"make it work\" when there's so little to work with--an issue that's currently facing the plus size fashion community.\nSo far, the ratings for the \"Project Runway\" spinoff \"aren’t that good,\" Tim Gunn admitted as he took the stage with author and curator Valerie Steele at the Brooklyn Museum Thursday evening.\nTim Gunn fans, you're about to get your dose doubled.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T08:49:41Z\",\"url\":\"https://fashionista.com/2012/01/tim-gunn-is-getting-a-daytime-talk-show-and-considering-designing-a-plus-size-line\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"The fastest four months of the year are here, and like always they are flying by.\nIt’s hard to believe that we are already a quarter of the way through the regular season and with week four about to get underway, the contenders are starting to separate themselves from the pretenders. So, without further ado, it’s time to break down the top games in the top conference for the fourth week of the season.\nThe Crimson Tide gets their first real test of the season this weekend as Jimbo Fisher’s 22nd-ranked Aggies come to Tuscaloosa. The Aggies have looked strong early in Fisher’s tenure, pounding two cream-puffs, along with a near-miss against second-ranked Clemson. Texas A&M will become the first team to hang with Alabama for more than a quarter, but still expect Alabama to pull away late.\nThe defending SEC champion Georgia Bulldogs face their toughest task of the season as well, as they head on the road for a night game against Missouri and their high-flying offense led by top NFL prospect, quarterback Drew Lock. Many people thought that South Carolina would give the Dawgs a run for their money two weeks ago, and that didn’t work out too well, but this will be different. The Tigers’ offense is for real and they will be able to keep pace with Georgia for a little bit, but the Dawgs, led by quarterback Jake Fromm, will be able to outscore them.\nThe under-the-radar game of the week is going to be played in Lexington, Kentucky, and it doesn’t involve John Calipari. After stunning Florida in the Swamp, getting their first win over the Gators in 32 years, the Wildcats look like they have their best team in over a decade, under head coach Mark Stoops. They will be joined on Kroger Field by another underrated 3-0 SEC team in Mississippi State. The Bulldogs have a team under first-year head coach Joe Moorhead that could seriously contend for the college football playoff, and quarterback Nick Fitzgerald is a legit star. Kentucky is good, but Mississippi State has a chance to be special. This will be close for awhile, but the Bulldogs will score a couple of touchdowns late to put the game away.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T04:47:03Z\",\"url\":\"https://smokeroom.com/2018/09/20/best-college-football-games-of-week-four/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"When SAVVY designed this branded leave behind for Riggs Distributing, a supplier of high-end kitchen appliances, we focused on making it a keeper. People have no problem tossing a magnet or calendar, but a hardcover book is another story.\nSo, we crafted a turned-edge rigid box with hinged lid to resemble a vintage book. The leatherette cover featured a fabric spine, foil and emboss and a litho printed interior. Inside, we put a stash of note paper printed with the Riggs logo. The client says the piece was a big hit.\nNo corners were cut in creating this beautiful catalog set for Ronbow, a maker of affordable luxury bathroom furniture and fixtures. We matched the exceptional design and photography of our partner, Hatch Design, with SAVVY touches. Attention to detail, careful color correction and a well-executed print job all convey product quality. Ronbow agreed that the new catalog elevated their work and their image.\nThis project was all about keeping the design clean and unobtrusive and letting Eva’s juicy imagery speak for itself. The 38-page book for a promotional mailing was perfect bound and featured a selection of the client’s latest lifestyle and food photography. Also included, little personal glimpses to bring Eva to life—her favorite family recipe on a perforated recipe card and a poster insert illustrating behind-the-scenes adventures.\nCommercial photographer Laurie Frankel chased her vision for years. She wanted to transfer her images onto impossibly thin tissue paper—affordably. SAVVY was thrilled to help Laurie finally make it happen.\nWe produced poster-sized prints of her Recycled Beauty series, exquisite still lifes fashioned from trash and broken down fruit. Underprinting her full-color images with white made them pop without obscuring the delicateness of the tissue. These promo pieces won Laurie clients as well as recognition from Communications Arts and Graphis. She called on SAVVY for three more tissue promotions.\nOur long-time partner, Stephen Gould Corporation, brought SAVVY to the table to carry out the vision of Yves Behar’s design agency for Jawbone. The “fall-away” package opened like an automated banana peel. Also included was an intricate laser-cut sleeve, single-face corrugate, foil stamp and UV lithography, as well as 100% recycled materials.\nWe produced these beautiful GE Social Light prototypes in cooperation with Stephen Gould Corporation for mass production consideration. SAVVY was commissioned to execute the designers’ concepts from 3D model to thermoform, print and CAD cut to retail-ready prototypes.\nThis sleek modular packaging says cool and tech, just like Lumo Bodytech’s health/sports wearable devices. The box and multi-piece inserts were conceived by our longtime collaborator Daylight Design. Then SAVVY took on the design for manufacturing and production. From paper and bamboo pulp to polypropylene, we chose construction materials for function and true recyclability.\nFrom day one to delivery, SAVVY saved the client time and money. We produced the package components at our partner factory in Kunshan, China, and transported them directly to Lumo Bodytech's Chinese contract manufacturer.\nThis sophisticated child resistant package screams “super cool”, just like the award winning ACES Extracts and Disposable Vaporizer - High Times 1st Place at 2018 Cannibis Cup.\nSAVVY conceptualized, structurally designed DFM ready, and prototyped the unique child resistant enclosure four part dual sleeve package. The rigid turned edge tray features an insert that proudly displays the disposable vaporizer in its clear acrylic enclosure. Then, nicely wrapped by a dual slide sleeve that pulls away in opposing directions.\nAnother fast and furious project produced in cooperation with our long-time partner, Stephen Gould Corporation. These JAMBOX VIP KITS feature a retro design making the most of single-face corrugate, silk screen and UV lithography, as well as 100% recycled materials. The client was delighted with the high quality work as well as the on-time and on-budget execution of the project.\nKrave wrote the book on healthy gourmet jerky. Our job was to produce a piece to tell their story. How about a box set of storybooks, each laying out the tale of a different flavor? Oh, and a packet of jerky tucked in for immediate gratification.\nThe challenge was making the story books manufacturable. Done! The kit features UV lithography, spot varnish and a register-to-print emboss. We also created a rigid, turned-edge box with an intricate laser-cut lid and extra components, including a USB key.\nOh, baby! Our clients at endue wanted stylish packaging that matched the quality of their organic infant clothing sets. And, this hinged lid, rolled edge gift box turned out exactly the way they envisioned. Not without some production challenges, however. The large embossed pinwheel required a creative duplex design to achieve the desired deep impression. This carefully handcrafted box was nothing short of fabulous.\nSAVVY executed DFM through mass production of the FaceCase Phone Case, Make-up Tins, Tools & Packaging.\nThe FaceCase Phone Case was injection molded in ABS, electroplated on all visible surfaces and assembled. It features a hinged lid with mirror and a magnetic pallet designed to carry makeup tins for easy access.\nSAVVY also designed and manufactured the premium hinged lid rigid retail package.\nSAVVY, and long time partner Double Six Design, were called upon to produce the “Feed-the-Friendship” Cesar Placemat DNA Kit and deliver them to each contest winner. SAVVY took on a list of assignments, from DFM and manufacturing of the food grade silicon Cesar Placemat, DFM and manufacturing of the packaging, and its contents, to kitting and fulfillment.\nSAVVY was pleased to drive the design and production of a premium package for Ford Global.\nThe OpenXC interface deserved a one-of-a-kind presentation. We created a sophisticated leatherette-wrapped, hinged lidded box with a magnetic closure, full color litho sleeve and a bit of foil bling. Inside, the OpenXC module is nested in frosted acrylic.\nSAVVY also steered production of the OpenXC module. Starting from its inner electronics to injection molding, and final assembly.\nA combination of practical and super-cute is what blingsting asked for. SAVVY made sure they got it. We shepherded the entire product line-up from first pencil sketch to 3D design and prototype, all the way to mass production and logistics.\nProduction processes include electronics fabrication, injection molding, electroplating, metal casting, plating, glitter and rhinestone decoration.\nThe super-cute packaging, also produced by SAVVY, adds a final touch of bling, a hallmark of the blingsting brand.\nThese iconic water flasks, from a SAVVY-led DFM and production project, are sold out in every color on the Fred Water site the moment they were offered.\nThe complex construction of the Fred Flask was a challenge, and the SAVVY team tackled it eagerly. SAVVY created a fabrication plan that included metal stamping, laser cutting, laser welding, proprietary coating techniques and laser etching of the 18/8 stainless steel.\nSAVVY also designed a premium packaging set, lanyards and other swag items to be included with each Fred Flask.\nThis dynamic project had applied graphics throughout. Our contribution ranged from rigid acrylic and printed vinyl to fabric tension graphics, plus hardware and installation. Even with the accelerated production schedule SAVVY delivered on time and on budget.\nThe concept and structural design are pure SAVVY. Navitas management and staff loved these branded, handcrafted lanyards to wear when they exhibit at natural food expos. We built in a functional twist: storage for the ultimate trade show item...business cards. A thumbhole for popping out the cards makes the Navitas folks quick on the draw. The holders are backprinted on clear acrylic, router cut, hand glued and heat polished.\nTeeny Cake was looking for maximum exposure with their small-business budget, so they brought in SAVVY. We updated their logo and translated the new design into an eye-catching vehicle wrap. SAVVY'S art direction and expertise in outdoor graphics, along with an experienced install team made short work of creating a delivery van that also doubles as full-time advertising.\nOur long-time partner, American Packaging, called on us to create a SAVVY solution for presenting buried treasure. To showcase North America’s largest cache of unearthed 19th century gold coins, we designed and produced a weathered-looking, period-correct box. For true Western personality, we heat branded the Saddle Ridge initials on this memorable leave behind.\nThe limited-edition, handcrafted wood box featured a false bottom, router-cut cavities and a hinged lid. Also included was a mini-storybook with a chocolate brown cover that incorporated white underprint and process print, spot varnish and register-to-print emboss.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T17:59:44Z\",\"url\":\"https://savvyprint.com/solutions\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"When we think of domestic violence, the image that most often comes to mind is that of an aggressive male perpetrator and a beaten female victim. However, the American Journal of Public Health’s most recent large-scale study of domestic violence shows that in reality, women are actually more often the perpetrators.\nDr. Donald Dutton believes that this research shows that domestic violence is more common in lesbian relationships than in heterosexual relationships.

{"text":"The three main kinds of surgery for weight loss are gastric sleeve, gastric bypass, and gastric banding.\nGastric sleeve (also called sleeve gastrectomy) is the most common weight loss procedure. With this operation, the surgeon removes part of the stomach and makes a tube or \"sleeve\" out of the rest of the stomach. The new, banana-shaped stomach is much smaller than the original stomach.\nAfter the operation, a person will eat less, feel full sooner, and be less hungry. The gastric sleeve operation only changes the stomach. The gastric sleeve procedure is not reversible.\nIn a gastric bypass (also called \"Roux-en-Y\" gastric bypass), a surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach. This pouch becomes the new stomach. Surgeons then connect the pouch to the middle part of the small intestine, bypassing the upper part of the small intestine.\nAfter the surgery, the stomach pouch holds a lot less food than a normal-sized stomach. A person will eat less, feel full sooner, and be less hungry. And fewer calories and nutrients are absorbed because the small intestine is shorter.\nPeople who get gastric bypass tend to lose more weight than people who get the gastric sleeve, but there can be more problems too. The gastric bypass procedure is not reversible.\nGastric banding is not an option for most teens. As with the other kinds of surgery, gastric banding makes the stomach smaller. The surgeon puts an adjustable silicone band around the top part of the stomach to create a small pouch. People who get the band feel fuller sooner and eat less.\nThe band is connected to a port under the person's skin. The doctor uses the port to adjust the size of the pouch by tightening or loosening the band. The band can even be completely deflated or removed entirely, letting the stomach return to its normal size.\nGastric band surgery has fewer complications than the bypass and sleeve options. However, people who get the band don't lose as much weight. Gastric band devices are not FDA-approved for people younger than 18.\nWhat Are the Risks of Weight Loss Surgery?\nPeople who've had weight loss surgery may have pain after eating. They might throw up, get diarrhea, or have acid reflux (heartburn) after eating — especially if they eat too much or too fast.\nAfter surgery, people need to get used to eating very small amounts. They need to chew their food more than they used to and space meals out during the day. If they don't, they might feel sick. They might even start gaining weight again.\nFood can move too fast through the stomach and intestines after weight loss surgery (especially gastric bypass). Doctors call this \"dumping syndrome.\" It can cause nausea, weakness, sweating, cramping, and diarrhea. Eating high-sugar or high-fat foods can make dumping worse. Patients need to be careful about what they eat as their bodies get used to a different way of digesting food.\nPeople who have had weight loss surgery might not get all the nutrition they need. One reason is they are eating less. Also, when food doesn't move through the entire digestive system, the body can't absorb as many vitamins and minerals. After surgery, most people take vitamin and mineral supplements.\nMental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are a concern before and after surgery. Most people feel better about themselves after weight loss surgery, but some may continue to struggle. It is important for people who have had weight loss surgery to follow up with their mental health professional and get help if they feel overwhelmed or sad, or have other emotional concerns.\nWeight loss surgery is no magic fix. But the hard work may be worth it for people who are very overweight and have serious health problems because of their weight.\nIf you're worried about your weight or are thinking about weight loss surgery, talk to your doctor.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-19T17:26:49Z\",\"url\":\"https://teenshealth.org/en/teens/bariatric.html?WT.ac=p-ra\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Low fertility among educated women threatens to lower the supply of high-skilled workers.\nWhile the world's population is still growing, there is already a serious shortage of babies in most developed countries. In Singapore, for example, the total fertility rate per woman stands at 1.4 children, far below the 2.1 children needed to replace its 4 million people.\nEven more worrisome, the few babies that do get born are disproportionately born to less educated and poorer mothers. In the U.S., for example, among women college graduates born 1960 - 1964, the average number of children born by age 40 is only 1.6. On the other hand, among women high-school dropouts, the equivalent number is 2.6.\nThere may be other non-economic reasons involved for this disparate birth pattern. But there is no denying that the opportunity cost of having children is much higher for highly educated women than poorly educated women. The upward momentum of wages is thwarted no matter when a high-skilled educated woman has a child (See The Family Gap). For low-skilled women, their wages stay low anyway. There are little benefits in delaying motherhood or reducing the number of babies.\nGiven that the chance of getting a good education is low for babies born to poorly educated women; this birth pattern bodes ill for the competitiveness of young workers in the developed countries. In an age where even knowledge-based jobs can be easily offshored to countries with cheap labor, developed countries can ill afford to have workers who are less educated than the developing countries to which skilled jobs have been outsourced.\nThere are of course low-skilled jobs that are location-bound and cannot be easily outsourced to labor-abundant countries. But the oversupply of low-skilled workers for these low-skilled jobs makes it difficult to elevate their wages.\nHarvard Magazine. \"Fertility and Destiny.\" March - April 2005.\nWSJ. 1/30/2003. \"Cupid the Bureaucrat?

{"text":"247MG is first and foremost an adult affiliate program for quality Indian content. Best of all, with 33 sub-niche sites the Indian content is easily promoted alongside many other popular niches, such as lesbians, housewives, and creampies. Unfortunately though, there is little in the way of promotional tools other than galleries and banners to assist affiliates in their marketing. Still, as decent quality Indian content is exceedingly rare, 247MG is an excellent program for those affiliates interested in promoting the rather under-saturated Indian niche – making it easily the best program for Indian content reviewed to date.\nSites: 43 – Hover here to view them.\nType of Content: High Res Pics and HD Videos – AVI, DivX, Flash, MP4, MPEG, and WMV.\nAs affiliates who promote the Indian niche can tell you, good quality Indian adult content is rather hard to find. More often than not, it’s pretty grainy stuff that is not always readily identifiable as being Indian. Either that, or it’s the same re-hashed licensed content that is found on dozens of other Indian adult sites out there. Happily, that is not the case with the 247MG program. Most of the content is of good quality, with some excellent quality high resolution photos and high definition videos also available, depending upon the site. Additionally, the program offers a plethora of exclusive content – though it should be noted that it does appear as if some of that content is shared across the network of sites. In other words, while it is still exclusive to the program, it is not necessarily exclusive to just a single site.\nWhile the program does continue to update, those updates are fairly inconsistent. New hosted galleries generally arrive in large batches over a couple of days, but then it may be upwards of two months before the next batch is added, though often sooner. Unfortunately, the galleries are generally bereft of any unique scene description text, though the corresponding sites do contain many scenes with said descriptions that will probably prove invaluable to affiliates drafting their own promotional copy.\nIn addition to new promotional galleries being added for their existing network of Indian sites, affiliates will also be pleased to note that the 247MG program continues to add brand new sites to that network, complete with their own brand new promotional galleries and banners. With three new sites having been recently added in just the past few months, affiliates can reasonable expect that they aren’t done yet, and still more are forthcoming.\nAlthough the 247MG adult affiliate program has loads of exclusive and good quality Indian content in an otherwise under-saturated niche, that alone is not enough to say the program is one of the overall best. Though, it is a certainly a good start. However, it is easy to say that this program is one of, if not THE best in the Indian niche. Affiliates already promoting Indian content, as well as those looking to promote an under-saturated niche, should definitely consider the 247MG program.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T12:42:18Z\",\"url\":\"https://qualityadultaffiliates.com/247mg/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Kgosi is Khama’s close ally. One of Masisi’s first acts as president was to fire him as intelligence boss.\nThe once feared head of Botswana’s Directorate of Intelligence Services (DIS), Isaac Kgosi, is in police custody after his arrest at Gaborone’s Sir Seretse Khama Airport on suspicion of tax evasion.\nThe arrest sent shock waves through Botswana, amid fears that it could worsen tensions between President Mogweetsi Masisi and his predecessor, Ian Khama.\nDuring his arrest on Tuesday this week, he loudly threatened to topple the government.\nThough not yet charged, it is understood that Kgosi is being investigated in connection with alleged tax evasion.\nThe DIS, the Botswana Police and the Botswana Revenue Services spent the better part of Wednesday searching his house in the affluent Gaborone suburb of Phakalane Estates.\nThe once feared former spy chief was greeted with an arrest warrant and handcuffs on his return from a trip to Asia and the Middle East, accompanied by his wife and children.\nThe arrest and raid on his house were coordinated by his successor, DIS director general Peter Magosi.\nTempers flared at the airport as Kgosi demanded to know why he was being arrested in such a public way. As he was being handcuffed in the open lobby of the airport, he protested that the whole exercise was intended to embarrass him.\nHe started hurling insults at his captors, declaring that he had always worked hard for Botswana.\n“You guys are driving me to do things I never thought I will do. I am going to topple the government, I’m telling you,” he said.\nHis lawyer, Unoda Mack, dismissed the statement as “a flight of hyperbole”, saying that had been caught off guard.\nHe said his client was calmer on Wednesday and cooperating with the authorities.\nSpeaking to the media, Magosi said Kgosi would remain in custody while investigations continue. He said it was still too early to tell if he would finish up in court, as the investigation was in its infancy.\n“All we can say now is that there was a joint operation between us, the Botswana police and [the revenue service]. Our investigations required us to search his home,” he said.\nIt is understood that Kgosi’s other properties, including another house in Gaborone and farms, will also be searched.\nKgosi’s attorneys confirmed that he spent the night in custody.\n“From the document that we have seen, they are looking for documents or storage devices that could assist in an investigation regarding tax issues. That’s all the document discloses,” Mack said.\nPolitical analyst Leonard Sesa said that the manner of Kgosi’s arrest would only deepen the rift between Khama and Masisi.\n“I have long said that the war between the president and his predecessor is no ordinary conflict,” he said. “If it is not nipped in the bud, this thing is going to end up in civil war.\n“The revenue service had suspicions that there might be irregularities regarding tax and they have the right to investigate,” he said.\n“While it was very foolish for Kgosi to talk about toppling the government, I think it was only out of frustration because he is used to having so much power. He was trying to intimidate the arresting officers,” he said.\nThe DISS was established amid controversy shortly after Khama assumed office in 2008.\nMoney from the government’s Disaster Fund were diverted to help establish the organisation, amid strong resistance from opposition MPs and some backbenches from the ruling Botswana Democratic Party.\nKgosi, at the time Khama’s private secretary, was appointed to head the new body. With presidential support he quickly turned it into the most powerful security organ in the country. Well-funded and largely unaccountable, the DIS was shielded by Khama – despite allegations of corruption against Kgosi and human rights abuses.\nThis story was produced by the INK Centre for Investigative Journalism.\nThe amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, an independent non-profit, provided this story.

A false Negative represents a test not detecting a difference when a difference does exist.\n1 – β = Power = the probability of a test detecting a difference when one exists.\nPower is therefore a measure of the sensitivity of a statistical test. It is common to target a Power of 0.8 for statistical tests. A Power of 0.8 indicates that a test has an 80 percent probability of detecting a difference.\nThe four variables that are required in order to determine the Power for a one-sample t-Test are Alpha (α), Effect Size (d), Sample Sizes (n1 and n2), and the Number of Tails. Typically alpha, Effect Size, and the Number of Tails are held constant while sample sizes are varied (usually increased) to achieve the desired Power for the statistical test.\nAs mentioned, the four variables that are required in order to determine Power for a one-sample t-Test are Alpha (α), Effect Size (d), Sample Size (n), and the Number of Tails.\nThe Power achieved for this test is 0.5416. This means that the current one-tailed test has a 54.16 percent chance of detecting a difference that has an effect size of 0.623 if α = 0.05, n1 = 16, and n2 = 17.\nThis would indicate that a Power of 80 percent would be achieved for this test if the total sample size were equal to approximately n1 + n2 = 65.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T00:48:12Z\",\"url\":\"http://blog.excelmasterseries.com/2014/05/2-sample-pooled-t-test-power-with.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, i.e. the derivation of laws, and  what is incomparably more important  it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its favour.\nwhich last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term mc2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a point-mass; depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential significance later.\nThe most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is to be attached to it.\nThe principle of relativity requires that the law of the concervation of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system K, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system K1 which is in a state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or, briefly, relative to every \" Galileian \" system of co-ordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics; the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another.\nwe see that the term mc2, which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body 2) before it absorbed the energy E0.\nA direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time (1920; see Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that the changes in energy E0 to which we can Subject a system are not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system.\nis too small in comparison with the mass m, which was present before the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity.\nLet me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of relativity.\n1) E0 is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body.\n2) As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T08:34:46Z\",\"url\":\"https://beyondweird.com/einstein/contents/ch15.htm\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence ($20) is yet another fabulously great Korean skincare product that’s low in coast and extremely effective. You might recall earlier this month I reviewed CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence which might have made you turn away in disgust. If the idea of using snail extract on your face isn’t terribly appealing yet you’re still intrigued by the highly moisturizing formula you might find Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence a better option.\nI’m of the strong belief that those suffering dullness or finer lines will see a smoother, brighter complexion if they inject a healthy amount of moisture into their diet. I can’t say I have finer lines on my face yet unless you count under my eyes. I do however, suffer from dullness and I always find that the more moisture I’m using the better my complexion looks.\nCosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence is one of those star products that will not only hydrate your skin but also, helps to retail moisture and that to me is very important.\nFinding a product to hydrate your skin quickly and effectively is a pretty easy task! Moisturizers are loaded with ingredients like glycerin, jojoba, argan, and ceramides to smooth, soften, and hydrate your skin. But sometimes results can be fleeting depending on the ingredients in the formula and your skin is back to being dry again if you aren’t consistent with application. Find a product that retails moisture is key. You want something that not only hydrates your skin but also helps you to retain that moisture and even works to draw more moisture into your ingredient.\nIn recent years, Hyaluronic Acid/Sodium Hyaluronate has become a star product for moisture retention. This particular ingredient acts like a magnet, drawing moisture into your skin and holding it. Apparently it can hold up to six liters of water and it does so without being heavy, greasy, or oily.\nCosrx’s Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence is a thin runny gel-texture that has a slightly tacky texture with absolutely no fragrance. The thing most fans of Cosrx is the fact they don’t include a lot of fillers in their skincare. They include the very important basics and that’s it. And in doing so, they create a very effective formula. One of the few ingredients in this essence is Sodium Hyaluronate which acts to draw moisture into your skin. It’s a very gentle formula that when used daily will improve the texture of skin as well as ease dullness while hydrating dull, dry, and dehydrated skin types. It’ll work across the board for a variety of skin types because the formula is so gentle and doesn’t create unnecessary oil or shine nor will it clog pores. Of course, everyone’s skin varies but this is a formula that should work for many.\nYou do want to remember to seal this product so, using it alone isn’t going to be as effective as using it in conjunction with your own moisturizer. Apply one to two pumps to your face and gentle place your palms against your skin to allow the product to absorb. It does have a slightly tacky feel at first but once absorbed that tackiness disappears. After application, apply your favorite moisturizer.\nSmooth, soft, well hydrated skin that will be well protected against environmental damage (but please don’t forget your SPF as well!) and even acts to reverse damages caused by the environment.\nIf your skin is looking a little dull lately I’d wildly suggest trying this out for yourself and seeing the visible difference.\nCosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence is available now at ulta.com and comes with a Muse Approval.\nHave you tried their Galactomyces? I’m curious about it, but since my skin is dry, maybe this HA essence will work better.\nI have but I really didn’t notice any major brightening from it!\nDo you prefer this over the Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion – or are they not comparable products/the same step in a routine?\nDifferent textures, different formulas, Monica! This is more a runnier gel and it absorbs a little easier. Hada Labo Lotion (not milk) is literally a liquid and a lot sticker, tackier. In comparison, both hold and retain water well but you might benefit more from Hada Labo if you have drier skin because it really is a supremely good pick for retaining moisture and keeping skin plush and pumped! I prefer Hada Labo in the evening and Cosrx in the AM as it wears better under makeup versus Hada Labo’s formula that takes a little longer for application and also to set.\nHow does this compare to the Hada Labo Gokujyun HA Lotion?\nDifferent textures, different formulas.

I was just shopping at rose rose shop earlier and she has all her cosrx stuff 30% off. I’m not affiliated, just an enabler. 🙂 Thought I would let you know!\nOh exciting!! Have you tried their Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream? If not, will you? I would love to hear your opinion on it.\nI have 😀 I’m actually going to try and follow up with a review on it this week 😀 maybe today!\nProb will try this after I finish the Hada Labo orange top. Adore Cosrx. Low ingredient lists are good for those of us with reactive skin. Easier to figure out what causes the problem. And being anti-fragrance in skincare is not easy, when you lost your sense of smell. Great tip, Siangali. Thanks.\nMs. Muse, I am a 40 something with generally “normal” to slightly occasionally dry skin , but dessicated under eyes. By the end of a 15 hour day, my face generally looks and feels kind of tight and my foundation can get a bit flaky. Do you think I would be better off with the Cosrx snail musin, hyaluronic acid, or both? If both, one in the a.m. and one in the p.m., or can you layer them without feeling as sticky as a movie theatre floor? Thanks!\nMy pleasure 🙂 Let me know how it works out!\nGood morning, Isabella. I ended up buying the Cosrx snail mucin at Ulta, using points (win!) and liked it, so I got the hyaluronic acid power essence from Cosrx also. So far, they seem to be great additions to me skin care routine. I am using: (a.m.) hydrating toner, AHA/BHA toner, snail mucin, antioxidant serum, and moisturizer with SPF. (P.m.) hydrating toner, hyaluronic acid essence, retinol serum mixed with a drop or 2 of jojoba oil, and moisturizer mixed with a drop or two of argan, Maryland, and/or rose hip oil. found that adding oils to my routine at night really reduced the amount of oil my skin produces during the day, such that I am no longer combination/oily, but normal to dry. I actually prefer normal to dry, because my make up where’s much better throughout the day. The addition of the two Cosrx essences really seems to be helping to avoid my skin getting to dry by the end of a long workday. Thanks for the reviews! Two thumbs up!\nUgh, Siri. Marula, not Maryland oil.\nYou say to “seal” this product with a moisturizer. I use facial oils every night after my essences is that ok? After i let the oil sink in I follow with an aloe Vera gel. Would I still get the benefits of this hyaluronic acid essence doing this.\nCan you please suggest a moisturizer to use for combination skin type, after applying that cosrx hydra power essence? Thanks!\nI’m not really sure, I have dry skin so most of my recs come from that place! I’m sorry, wish I knew a good combo moisturizer but honestly, at a loss since I shop dry skin everything!\nSo what’s your nightly skin routine and does it differ during the day? I live in Colorado and the dryness/ lack of humidity is killing my skin! I actually peel in the winter!\nNightly and daily are most definitely different. I rotate a lot of products but this is mainly what I use in the evening.\nlaneige firming sleeping mask (I rotate sleeping masks often but right now this is what I’ve been using).\nI haven’t tried the ordinary can’t compare 🙁 sorry!\nI’m sorry! No thanks needed, I didn’t do anything 🙂 <3!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T04:15:44Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.musingsofamuse.com/2017/04/cosrx-hyaluronic-acid-hydra-power-essence-review.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"While many folks are still debating the specific financial pain the carbon tax will inflict on everyday Albertans, virtually every economist and academic agrees on one thing: the carbon tax won't make Albertans change their behaviour and adopt so-called \"low carbon lifestyles\". The carbon tax is simply a hidden consumption tax. While some politicians talk about \"revenue neutral\" carbon pricing, the NDP is using this tax boost government revenues to pay for their bad decisions. They have already increased corporate taxes, income taxes, and taxes on alcohol. Their new carbon tax could be described as a tax on keeping your house warm during winter and your car filled with enough gas to get you to work.\nAnd let's remember - it's a tax they didn't mention once in their campaign platform in the last election. They have no mandate from Albertans to bring in what is the single largest tax increase in Alberta's history.\nLast month the Fraser Institute published a stody showing that Alberta under the NDP has sunk to the 45th best place to invest in oil and gas in North America. Today they revealed that where Alberta was once the lowest taxed jurisdiction in North America, it is now the 16th highest. Who will choose Alberta as a place to do business under this government? Our competition is thrilled, the NDP is sending jobs, investment, and opportunity across the borders to BC and Saskatchewan.\nWe simply can't continue in this direction. We must take pride in our industry, unite under a competent, united, principled alternative to the NDP and bring back the Alberta Advantage.\nAnd let's axe the carbon tax!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T04:03:57Z\",\"url\":\"http://www.albertacantwait.com/new_year_new_taxes\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Home » Blog » differentiated learning » Are we really serious about ALL students learning science?\nIf we’re really serious about ensuring that all students learn science, then why do we continue the practice of moving on to the next topic before all the students are ready?\nBecause it’s impossible to manage a classroom if you’re trying to keep all 20-40 students together and you wait until every last one of them has the concept before moving on. The behavior and attention issues would drive even the most patient teacher up the wall.\nIn my experience it’s not that students CAN’T get something–it’s that they don’t have the background knowledge (or the prior experiences and understandings) to enable them to learn the new stuff in the same amount of time.\nSee…I taught chemistry for ten years and it (along with MANY subjects) is one of those things that if you don’t understand the stuff in the beginning then you’re NEVER going to catch up. If you can’t understand chemical formulas then you won’t be able to balance an equation, and if you can’t do either of those things then forget about getting to stoichiometry. And if you never “got” algebra in such a way that you can transfer it to other content areas then you’re going to really struggle with a lot of the math in chemistry.\nSo once a kid falls behind, the chances of them catching up are slim…they’re just trying to float along and not fail at that point.\nBut I really want my kids to UNDERSTAND what I’m doing in my classroom–if they’re just trying to float along and not fail, then what’s really the point?\nIf I could take the time to get kids caught up in the background knowledge, or at least take the time to supplement a student’s background knowledge where it specifically prevented them learning the new stuff, then I could teach them the new stuff.\nI came to a cross roads after my 8th year teaching where I just couldn’t justify teaching in this “teach to the middle” way any longer. It wasn’t respectful of the upper level kids (why should they be held back when they don’t need to be) or the lower level kids (why should I move on when they’re not ready…are they not worthy of learning the material?). Having multiple levels of a course (honors and regular, for example) can help somewhat with this issue, but even within those leveled courses there’s still variation in where students are at.\nSo I transformed my class into a Mastery Learning class. Each student moved on when and only when they were ready. They chose the ways in which they wanted to learn the material, used me and their peers as resources and personal tutors, gained the background knowledge that they’d been missing, filling in pieces, learned new content and moved on to the next lesson whenever they could show me mastery of the current lesson they were working on.\nKids that got something moved on quicker. Kids that didn’t get it as quick got to take the time, and get the attention, they need to get it and they moved on as well.\nI spent two years teaching in this way and am a true believer that it’s the ONLY way to get each student to learn the content. Yes, it was hard work on my part. Yes, it added some chaos to my life, but it was the only way that every student walked out of my classroom at the end of the year LEARNING chemistry and not just “not-failing” it.\nI wrote a book on teaching science with Mastery Learning, published by NSTA Press and you can find out more about it at the NSTA store website.\nBecause I’m not the only one that teaches this way and I certainly don’t have all the answers to all the questions someone might ask about teaching this way, I started a website (www.ScienceMasteryLearning.com).

{"text":"I know I have told you many times that I live in the most beautiful place on earth…but I really do! In June I went on a helicopter with Compass Helicopter Tours into the mountains to go spring glacier kayaking. Look at the colour of this water!!! Insane, right!?!\nLast year I went on a similar helicopter tour in August. I made a mental note that I really wanted to go in June this year when the ice was just starting to melt. There are “rivers” that are formed that are perfect for spring glacier kayaking. However, the timeframe for this is limited as within weeks the rivers will have turned to the lakes I saw last year.\nI am glad to know Nick from Compass Helicopter Tours and he knows the best time of year to get to experience the spring glacier kayaking and offers once-in-a-lifetime tours.\nThis year I put together a vlog with Joel to show you the beauty of this experience. I hope you enjoy it! Joel actually edited this one for me so give him a thumbs up and make sure you subscribe to my YouTube channel!\nNo, I didn’t jump in.

{"text":"We all have been there, coming home from work or school and just feeling completely drained not even knowing what in the world has happened for you to even feel this exhausted not just physically but mentally too. The body not only feels way too tired out but the mind is as well. Regrouping after a tough week or even a touch day is extremely important. As humans, we tend to stretch ourselves out way too thin, more than some can handle coming together with yourself after all of it is one of the biggest uses of self-care. It can be hard to think of ways to regroup for people who are just starting out so here are 5 ways to regroup after a tough week.\nDon’t knock it till you try it. A lot of people have the notion that meditating is a waste of time, only for hippies, it’s really not. Meditating is one of the best way to regroup think about it, it’s 10-20 minutes that you’re silent, breathing in and out, staying still and just focusing on your thought process. Many believe meditating is meant for you not to think and that’s hard because the human mind is made to think it even functions while we’re sleeping. Meditating is the process of seeing how and where your thoughts go to and recollecting them and changing your thought process and what of what you’re thinking of.\nFor many, the regrouping process involves a long shower or bath. Something about being fresh out the shower and having your body feel clean after a tough day can really make a difference in the way you feel about yourself and your day. Take your time, use your favorite scented soap, play all your favorite songs, wash your hair while you’re in there, cry it out as well no one’s judging, come out moisturize and notice the immediate change in mood.\nIf it’s been a tough week the chances are you also haven’t gotten enough sleep in some time. So many times people have heard this but sleep is vital to surviving as a human being and one of the major side effects of not having a good nights sleep is not being able to function properly, headaches, eyes burning and just overall being in a bad mood and not having enough energy. Let’s avoid that and get at least 8 hours of sleep even 10 hours if possible. Trust that you’ll see the difference.\nDo things that you enjoy doing by yourself. Whether that’s watching your favorite show for the tenth time, coloring in a coloring book, just laying in bed and listening to music. Do something small that you enjoy and brings you clarity and happiness, something that get’s you in a calm state of mind fulfills the kid inside of you. All work and no play can leave us all feeling down.\nMost of the time, social media, our phones are what’s draining us. It’s okay to take time away from the phones, they shouldn’t control you so much to the point that not using it for a few hours is a pain to you. Shut it off, tell the people that you need to tell that you’ll talk to them later. Take time to be in the moment with yourself.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T20:49:35Z\",\"url\":\"https://collegecandy.com/2019/04/10/best-ways-to-regroup-after-tough-week/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

This tour group was particularly interested in technical issues related to: soil/vegetation approaches for water quality treatment; the ultra- violet finishing treatment that allows for human contact with the treated water; and soil capping issues for a former brownfield site. GreenWorks typically leads 4-6 tours per year since Tanner Springs Park opened in 2005. Tour groups have included national and international professional and environmental organizations and academic institutions. Visitors are interested in a variety of issues, including design inspiration, public involvement and outreach, and technical challenges.\nCouch Park comment forms for the playground and plaza improvements are due Thursday December 10th.\nGreenWorks was been hired by Portland Parks & Recreation to design the new playground, address accessibility issues in the plaza and install a new Portland Loo at Couch Park as part of the Parks Replacement Bond. We presented the three options below for the playground at an Open House on December 3rd . Online comments are due Thursday December 10th and can be found here: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/68915. One of the top priorities for the playground is for it to be inclusive, which mean that it should be designed for children of all ages and abilities. We have been working closely with Mara Kaplan from Let Kids Play http://www.letkidsplay.com/ who is a national expert and advocate for inclusive playground design. Mara was brought on to the design team to help us design a playground that provides exceptional play opportunities for all children.\nGreenWorks met with the city of Astoria to present the Downtown Astoria Pedestrian Wayfinding Concept Plan. Those in attendance were city officials, focus group members, and Astoria community members. The presentation focused on distinct sign typologies that direct and inform pedestrians getting around downtown Astoria. Following the presentation was an interactive group discussion about sign locations, aesthetic preferences interpretive sign opportunities.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T07:14:19Z\",\"url\":\"https://greenworkspc.com/blog/category/Public+Outreach\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"The power of song is deeper than you can imagine. In the Bible, it talks music. Music has existed in the world since the beginning of time!\nInstruments and music are discussed in the Bible. Since the beginning, human beings have made instruments and played music. King David was a musician and played the harp. He created a whole book known as the Book of Psalms. Think about it – even the king of Israel found music to be an important part of life!\nWhen the prophets used to get prophecy, it could only happen when they were in a state of happiness. And how could they potentially attain happiness? Through music. What an unbelievable concept. Music is so ancient and holy!\nIt is so obvious when you look at the Bible and history how powerful music and song can be. In the Temple, the Levites would sing and play instruments. That was one of their jobs. And you can understand how important of a job that was! Music and song in the Temple, in such a holy place? It must have been an unreal feeling.\nThe Jewish people use music and tunes throughout the prayer services as well. It helps people connect to God in a way that words cannot always accomplish. So when you listen to and watch the musical gathering in this video, which is also known as a Kumzits, you can understand what these Hasidim might be feeling while they sing and sway. The music can bring them closer to God in ways they never thought possible!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T01:45:02Z\",\"url\":\"https://israelunwired.com/the-musical-gathering-that-shows-the-power-of-song/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"A winter break, softer fouls and the modernisation of our game, is there a European conspiracy to change the way we play our football?\n\"I know you invented the game, but here is where you&apos;re going wrong..\"\nEx-Wolves Star Mark Burke Asks : \"Is UEFA&apos;S Europeanisation Of Football Killing The English Game?\"\nThis article - Is There A UEFA Conspiracy To Ruin English Football Through Referees? - is from the voice of Midlands sport - Tom Ross, he believes there is some kind of plot by UEFA to undermine the English game by the banning of tackling and the harsh punishments that follow what are, in English eyes strong but fair challenges.\nI think this article raises a very, very important point, now I dont think in any way that UEFA are setting out deliberately influence English football this is being a little arrogant and assuming we are at the forefront of UEFA&apos;s mind or more specifically Michel Platini BUT the gradual &apos;Europeanisation&apos; of football and society in general is having a big, big impact on the English game, argue amongst yourselves whether its a good or bad influence.\nAside from the tackling issue which I&apos;ll get back to there are various things I think that need looking at. Now you might call me old fashioned after you red this but read it, think about and then call me old fashioned if you really want. I write these pieces about things that interest me and to start debate.\nThe English game has been built on a foundation of \"the best team wins the league, full stop, No arguments, and to do this, crucially, in the English manner, they must play in varying weather conditions, on various pitches, they must play at times of the year when NOBODY else is playing, christmas, new year, there is NO break, the games are played close together, the crowd are fanatical, a spectacle in themselves etc etc. This is what English football was famed for, why people want to come and watch, why TV wants to pay so much money for it.\nThe gradual &apos;Europeanisation&apos; of football and society in general is having a big, big impact on the Englsih game, argue amongst yourselves whether its a good or bad influence.\nThe tackling issue is also something that is troubling and symptomatic of a wider issue. I saw for myself in other countries I played in that what was a foul in those countries would not, a while ago be seen as anything like a foul in England but now we are reaching a point where across Europe there is standard being set for a foul ie as soon as studs are shown pheeep! Foul.\nThis is a little bit like the European experiment, where cultural differences, massive cultural differences are swept aside for a one size fits all policy, regardless of the fact that it doesn&apos;t work, cultures are too different, what suits the Germany doesnt suit the Greeks, it definitely doesn&apos;t suit the Greeks, as we are seeing and is spiralling slowly out of control.\nThis is coming from somebody who never tackled anybody in his lfe but for that reason I can really appreciate a good, strong fair tackle, we had a player at Middlesbrough - Gary Hamilton and when he tackled you he did it with his whole body, it was a pleasure to be tackled by him as he did it with such power and precision that you had to admire it as you were left on the floor in a heap.\nThe English game was initially developed,a hundred plus years ago as game of stamina, endurance and strength and this still runs true today, you see it in the eyes of the fans and feel it in your being at the grounds, that &apos;English&apos; roar, that passion that drives team forward is a special thing, this strange island nation (as my Dutch friends say) ready to fight any who dare cross us, this seeps into our football. We gave it to the world, they refined it to suit them and bloody heel now thet are beating us!\nThis culture, this tradition is in the blood of the English supporter, now with the influx of foreign talent, players and coaches, they, being I think in the majority now (?) then it is only normal that they will want the rules and the game changing to what they are used to but thats NOT the reason English football became so popular, which is NOT the reason why Sky paid so much for it, without which they would NOT have come.Ok some may have but in these numbers.\nSo as I was saying the game is bigger, brighter etc than ever before but it needs to retain its identity and what made it great in the first place, referees MUST be given licence to judge for themselves and not adhere to some dry assessment from above as to what is dangerous and what isn&apos;t and what isn&apos;t and stop running in fear from assessors, otherwise the game will become sterile, boring and god forbid the fans will start to turn their backs and when that happens?.... well thats it then, the game is nothing without them.\nWe must remember what made it great while still allowing room for modernisation and progression ie the stadiums after the terrible, terrible things that occurred in the 80&apos;s.\nAs I said at the start, I just want to start a debate and see what people think, some of the points may be old fashioned and not moving with the time but in anything.\nI am a true believer in preserving the essence, the soul, retaining the heart and the core and then building and modernising around that so the spirit shines through.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-19T20:42:46Z\",\"url\":\"https://sabotagetimes.com/football/ex-wolves-star-asks-is-uefas-europeanisation-of-football-killing-the-english-game\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"The Guerrilla Girls know how to silence a room. Dressed head-to-toe in black, their faces concealed behind snarling masks, the impression is something between a gang of bank robbers and superheroes in disguise. It’s unexpected when they speak in bright, amiable tones, approaching visitors to shake hands and pose for pictures. The somewhat jarring incongruity in this approach echoes the central tension between aggression and playfulness in their work, at its most distinctive in the lurid pink and yellow billboards that splashed shameful statistics on racial and gender imbalances in the art world during the 1980s. Thirty years later, a new exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London runs in tandem with a separate workshop at Tate Modern to revisit one of their most iconic statements, It’s Even Worse in Europe.\nThis summer, the Guerrilla Girls sent 14 identical questions to 383 European museum and gallery directors; only around a quarter responded, though nobody has escaped inclusion in the show. Those who declined or ignored the invitation have been relegated to the floor, with visitors invited literally to walk all over them. The raw material of their investigation forms the majority of the exhibition: reimagining the banal trappings of gallery administration as a performance, the viewer takes on the role of researcher, poring over reams of paperwork and lists of statistics. The register of responses tends to contrast between the colloquialisms of smaller, more independent galleries and the bulky, beaurocratic speak of the larger institutions. The collated questionnaires, presented in their unedited forms, are gathered into tomes, whilst some of the more scandalous revelations are emblazoned on posters around the walls.\nFurther exploiting and inverting the paraphernalia of bureaucracy, the Girls are supervising a Complaints Department as part of Tate Exchange, where participants are invited to air their grievances – on everything from gender politics to the inefficiency of the lifts at Tate – on oversized blackboards interspersed with Guerrilla Girls billboards. One of the Girls’ own posters kindly makes room for the complaints of misogynists past and present: Nature intended women to be our slaves. They are our property (Napoleon); Fat pigs, slobs, disgusting animals. I don’t have time for political correctness (Donald Trump). Whilst the work focuses on shaming institutions and individuals through exposure, the identity of the artists themselves remains protected. This creates friction between what is revealed and what remains hidden, a continuous balance between their own performative presence and their output.\nThe Whitechapel’s Archive Gallery curator Nayia Yiakoumaki presents the show alongside Xabier Arakistain, known also as Arakis, whom the Girls described in 2012 as \"the most committed, outrageous curator in all of Spain and probably the rest of the world.\" Yiakoumaki discussed how receiving the questionnaire herself provoked \"a profound engagement with our own institution, trying to be responsible and objective.\" This internal debate is exactly what the Girls hope to incite: having received criticism for allowing their practice of protest to become \"institutionalised,\" they responded, \"What do you do when the art world you’ve spent your whole life attacking suddenly embraces you? Well, you don’t waste time wondering if you’ve lost your edge. You take your critique right inside the joint.\"\nThe focus for much of their most recent work has indeed centered on the inner workings of the art world establishment. Their 2015 billboard, which appears at Tate Modern, skewers the entrenched art world culture of unpaid internships and pervasively low salaries: Dear Art Collectors: Art is sooo expensive! Even for billionaires! We completely understand why you can’t pay all your employees a living wage! Drenched in an acid sarcasm, the statement burns to the core of this most problematic habit of galleries and magazines, which implicitly favors those who can afford to work for free. As a consequence, it’s easy to empathize with the broad perception of the art world as peopled by homogenous swathes of privileged individuals. Such discriminatory practices relate to what the Guerrilla Girls term the \"bad behavio\" of US art institutions; that is, the opportunity for private, super-rich (usually white, usually male) individuals to dictate the collecting practices of public art spaces.\nThe proportion of private and state funding received by museums and galleries is clearly a central concern for the Guerrilla Girls, and their questionnaire probes institutions for details of their financial investors. Almost every respondent specified that the acquisition of funding was one of the most urgent issues facing their organization. In many ways, statistics represent a bottom line: concrete; quantitative; irrefutable. However, they can also be manipulated to obscure the real complexity of opportunity and representation. Last year, the socialist leader of the British opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, ensured gender parity in his shadow cabinet, but none of the most influential positions were entrusted to women. In politics and business, calls for positive discrimination are often met with criticisms that such policies are patronizing and tokenistic; a blunt solution to nuanced social problems. If art institutions were required to implement gender parity in their displays, alongside proportionate racial representation, would such a policy be enforced by the state? If less funding were available from private sources, thereby alleviating our public museums’ corporate responsibilities, might the state play a more interventional role in what art it deems appropriate for the public? From these questions arise new problems.\nIn re-examining their 1986 work, the Guerrilla Girls have shaped a new inquiry. Originally, the statement was based on anecdotal evidence, which has been supplanted by research-based analysis, and the conclusions drawn are just as disruptive as ever. In perhaps their most inclusive work to date, the viewer is a collaborator, utilized to parse the data and scrutinize the influences at work within the art world. Now, the declaration is transformed to pose the question: Is It Even Worse In Europe?\nDo Women Still Have To Be Naked To Get Into The Met Museum?\nSiobhán Forshaw is an independent writer and curator based in London.

{"text":"Modernity and the Millennium. Juan R. I. Cole.\nModernity and the Millennium : The Genesis of the Baha’i Faith in the Nineteenth-Century Middle East. Columbia University Press, 1998.\n“Some contemporary leaders of the Baha’i Faith have given answers increasingly similar to those of fundamentalists, stressing scriptural literalism, patriarchy, theocracy, censorship, intellectual intolerance, and denying key democratic values. While the values of the nineteenth-century Baha’i movement, which was far more tolerant, continue to exist as a minority view, by the late 1990s a different set of emphases prevailed” (196).\n“The rise of academic Baha’i scholarship has caused tension in the community, whose present-day leadership tends to be fundamentalist and antiliberal in orientation, and this has led to pressure on a number of prominent academics to resign or dissociate themselves from the movement” (201).\nThese same forces of fundamentalist orthodoxy are evident on talk.religion.bahai and alt.religion.bahai on Usenet for impartial viewers to witness. They will be evident to all perceptive observers of whatever forum Bahais may be trying to control and influence. Both my and Cole’s websites provide essential documentation along these lines. It should be noted that the Universal House of Justice has actively worked through the BCCA (Bahai Computer and Communications Association) to suppress all links to websites with other than its own “comprehensive” point of view on such major portals as Yahoo.com, Excite.com, and other search engines. The UHJ has reportedly gone even further by advising Bahais to remove any link whatsoever to Professor Cole’s website.\nAs a Bahai since 1976, I myself have always found especially repulsive the manner in which Bahai fundamentalists attempt to manipulate the institutions and leaders of government, the United Nations, and public opinion, while pretending to values they deride in private or at Bahai-only meetings.\n“These are effectual and sufficient proofs that the conscience of man is sacred and to be respected; and that liberty thereof produces widening of ideas, amendment of morals, improvement of conduct, disclosure of the secrets of the contingent world” (Abdu’l-Baha, A Traveler’s Narrative, 91).\nThe Universal House of Justice, in Haifa, Israel, is also in the end responsible for inciting Baha’i fanatics and fundamentalists to attack other Bahais and non-Bahais merely for their views expressed on and off line in free forums of public discussion.\nProfessor Cole’s Modernity and the Millennium will remain, for many years to come, the most important book available on the Baha’i Faith. His discussion of its historical development within the intellectual milieu of progressive 19th Century thought is particularly brilliant and insightful.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T15:12:12Z\",\"url\":\"https://fglaysher.com/TheGlobe/tag/modernity-and-the-millennium/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"United Hatzalah is an emergency medical service organization, founded in 2006. Their response time is 90 seconds or less. In the book of Isaiah, there is a verse that God tells Isaiah that the Jewish People “will be a light unto the nations”.\nUnited Hatzalah is a volunteer emergency medical service organization based in Jerusalem, Israel. It was founded in 2006 by Eli Beer. Hatzalah uses Ambucycles, a motorcycle, which on the back has a box with equipment that might be needed. Their mission is to provide care during the critical window of time until a traditional ambulance arrives.\nIn 2008 they developed the Life Compass GPS, it tracks the volunteers via GPS, to determine who is closest to the scene of the accident. It sends the volunteers on the fastest route possible to the scene, where they are needed. When a volunteer joins Hatzalah they are issued a smartphone which is automatically linked to the Life Compass.\nWith the ambucycles Hatzalah has a response time of under 3 minutes. They answer an average of 1000 calls a day. They answer calls no matter what religion, race or national origin. Since Hatzalah was founded, the rate of cardiac arrest deaths has decreased by 50% according to the Israel Heart Society.\nThe Jewish People have been told that they need to be a light unto the nations. They have shown that they are a light among the nations, the Jews have shown the world what they can do. David Ben Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel had a vision for the State, that it would be a light among the countries of the world.\nIsrael has done many things to help the world. Whichever country might be in need after an earthquake or a tsunami, Israel sends humanitarian aid, set up field hospitals, sends search and rescue parties and more. Israel has given the world, Waze, Whatsapp, GetTaxi and so much more, also in the medical world.\nIsrael has proven to the world what it can do. It has shown that it can be a light unto the nations.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T03:59:48Z\",\"url\":\"https://israelunwired.com/a-light-unto-the-nations-in-90-seconds-or-less/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Professor Barry Marshall is an Australian Nobel Prize Laureate in the field of gastroenterology and microbiology. Early in his career, Professor Marshall went into internal medicine with a gastrointestinal emphasis, working with Dr J. Robin Warren to demonstrate that Helicobacter pylori is the cause of most peptic ulcers. In this conversation, Professor Marshall describes drinking a dose of the bacteria himself in order to prove causation amongst risk taking in medicine as well as future directions in his field.\nI’d like to talk about the very famous story of how you drank a Petri dish containing cultured Helicobacter pylori to make the causal connection of the bacteria with peptic ulcers. Considering the resistance your findings faced by the medical and scientific community, what do you think the reasons were that people were unwilling to consider the connection? For example, do you think there was an economic motive?\nAt that point, I had been trying to infect rats and mice, guinea pigs and piglets for about six months and getting nowhere. It was kind of frustrating – I had no answer for that. I could not really do the next step. However, I did submit an MD thesis proposal and in that I said that if the animal work fails, then we would try to get a human volunteer experiment. So I had decided that I needed to go to that step. Looking back on it, it was riskier than I originally thought it was because I was pretty certain that I could eradicate it with antibiotics, but the ones I chose in fact probably wouldn’t have worked. I had an endoscopy to make sure I didn’t already have H. pylori. So I drank the bug thinking that I would just be asymptomatic. Most people I knew with H. pylori were infected blood donors. I found 40% of blood donors at Fremantle were infected and didn’t even know they had it. So obviously, it wasn’t killing them and no one could remember where they caught it from. There was no history involved with the infection so it was a bit of a puzzle.\nEven Dr. Warren and a couple of other people thought it might have been sexually transmitted, close contact with somebody, because ladies who attended the STD clinic were more likely to be infected than everybody else. There were a whole slough of crazy little pilot studies trying to sort the epidemiology out, it was very confusing. However, I drank the bug and I did become unwell with a vomiting illness and there was no acid in the vomit. That triggered something that I had read in an old medical textbook, The Principles and Practices of Medicine by Sir William Osler in 1910. They described exactly the acute illness that I had. I suddenly realized that these old descriptions of vomiting without any acid in the vomit were probably H. pylori and it became less common and people forgot about it.\nPutting it all together at that point, the endoscopy showed a very heavy infection with H. pylori, so it was lucky that I had chosen that strain because I could have chosen one that didn’t infect very well. However, I didn’t get an ulcer and the illness got better after two weeks – it was all over. Discussing it with a few colleagues enabled me to do this hypothesis article for the Medical Journal of Australia. I believe it is either the second or third most cited article in MJA with thousands of citations.\nWhat changes occurred in your life after receiving the Nobel Prize?\nI believe Nobel laureates develop a bit of an inferiority complex and maybe some paranoia. One of the things is that I’m always talking about things I know, I’m the font of knowledge for Helicobacter and I keep up in that field, but there are so many other topics that I don’t keep up with. If I pick up the Medical Journal of Australia, I’ll look at the headlines and think that I don’t have time to read certain articles. Similarly, I’m not going to have time to be able to read the journals that I used to read, so I get a bit paranoid about not keeping up.\nThe other thing is that you’re worried that you don’t have peer review as a Nobel laureate. If you say something, someone is happy to print it or put it up on the web. If I twitter about something and say “this is a load of rubbish” about the microbiome of the stomach, nobody else is saying that. So I think, am I nuts? I’m just looking for a little niche where I can fight the consensus. Anybody who says something is a consensus, I am immediately totally suspicious of it.\nMoving on to some of your current research, increasing antibiotic resistance accounts for 15% of patients who are not cured of their H. pylori infections. When these patients are referred to you, you isolate their strain, they receive a ‘tailor-made’ combination of antibiotics. I was hoping you could discuss how much of a threat you believe antibiotic resistance is with respect to H. pylori?\nIt’s a moderate threat, once you know how to get around it. You learn these principles of microbial therapy in medical school and it’s not going to change. Always, if you find the resistance pattern of the organism, you navigate around it with your antibiotics. The tricky part is that many of the antibiotics I like to use are active in the stomach and are often old. The best example is tetracycline. Everyone says “don’t use that, it’s not very well absorbed, it stays there in the lumen of the gut, it passes out in the stool.” Hang on a minute – that’s great for H. pylori.\nThere is need for further studies to work out the pharmacology of antibiotics in the gastric mucosa because when amoxicillin fails, we have no idea why it fails. All Helicobacter are always sensitive to amoxicillin. So you should be able to just give people amoxicillin and a PPI (proton pump inhibitor), and expect a cure. We’re not seeing that. So you have to add the third drug, there are different ones.\nSo I’m not too worried about it with Helicobacter, it’s a bit like a Streptococcus. It’s got a limited repertoire. However, it mutates extremely fast. It’s almost like a virus. According to a paper we did, its right on the top of the list for mutation. The reason is because it doesn’t have to protect its genome. There’s nothing else floating around much except other Helicobacters. So they’re all moving genes around, sucking them in and out as they divide. It doesn’t check the accuracy of its copying. So it’s continuously disabling its ribosomes or changing its ribosomes, so it very easily becomes resistant to macrolides or metronidazole. So it becomes interesting; there’s so many Helicobacter in your stomach – 1010 organisms. So for the stomach, it doesn’t matter that its doing bad copies of itself because it will just continue to have an evolution in the gastric mucosa. That’s why it becomes resistant to these things that require some interaction between an antibiotic and a functional protein, because they disable the protein in some way and then it’s resistant. So I think in the future, we need to do more studies on the pharmacology of the gastric mucosa and immunology. I’m optimistic that we’ll figure it out eventually. But, at the moment we haven’t made much progress in the last 10 years. That said, we still kill 99% of H. pylori that is referred to us.\nThe Marshall Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Training has a principle goal in facilitating the development of new vaccines for H. pylori. Given that the bacterium is part of the normal flora as you mentioned before, for approximately 50% of people, do you believe that non-pathogenic H. pylori should be eradicated?\nThis is the question that I had trouble with. So, statistically it is normal because half the people in the world have it, so they’re not at the two standard deviations from the mean to have H. pylori. However, it is a pathogen even in the normal flora. It’s been normal in stone age Man, ever since humans left Africa 70,000 years ago they’ve been carrying H. pylori – maybe even hundreds of thousands of years before that. So in that respect, you could say it is normal flora and it may have had a beneficial effect. The ones that get the press are due to the fact that it downregulates the immune system a little. The beauty of this might be that if you had H. pylori you were less allergic and everybody’s a little bit allergic so that’s okay. But there are these kids that are outliers in their allergy response who are way up high in their responsiveness. They’re the ones that get anaphylaxis. So maybe if you had H. pylori, you would be less likely to be up in that group, you’d be more down in the middle of the range. As humans migrated out of Africa and visited all these other continents, with different plants and animals, it’s possible that having H. pylori was a bit beneficial. You’re hiding in the bushes from a lion, all of a sudden you start sneezing, that would not be good. Being less allergic might have helped human migrations.\nNowadays, Helicobacter has been disappearing by about 50% every generation in the last 50 years. So since about 1960, in Western countries it’s just been declining. It’s not antibiotics. It’s better hygiene, smaller families and it’s not terribly infectious. If you have both parents infected, each child has about a 50% chance of picking it up from an Australian parent. It’s in the next generation, but not a lot. So you can’t blame me if Helicobacter disappears. I’m killing it, I’m doing my best, but in fact 90% of the work is just done by modern living in 21st century life.\nAre there any other medical issues that you would like to see gaining the same attention as the microbiome?\nI think the immune system of the gut is important. We can put things into the stomach and into the colon, but the small intestine we can’t really investigate. As far as I’m concerned, there’s only two causes of anything: genetic and environmental, in particular all the viruses that you catch in the first few years of life. I think we’ve got a long way to go but we are on the threshold of cheap sequencing. So what we’re going to see is a lot of cheap sequencing during the lifetimes of lots of people. Then maybe 10 years from now, we will have computers big enough to figure out what it all means. We will probably be able to see that a lot of it is viral triggers – who knows.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T14:24:42Z\",\"url\":\"https://vector.amsa.org.au/2018/06/10/interview-with-professor-barry-marshall/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

Nothing short of a roller coaster ride could sum up this year for me.\nPaycut, seeing my colleagues getting retrenched, petty office politics and a change of job. Presidential elections, Brexit, and how to forget the number of celebrities 2016 took away from us.\nAs i'm writing this, i'm watching news broadcast of Carrie Fisher's passing.\nOnly a few more days before this nightmarish year ends and 2016 is still full of surprises.\nIt's been a interesting year for sensualsingapore too. My love from the star vista brought a lot more visitors to the blog, so did my adventure in the office. As a result, i got more mails and submission of ideas for future works.\nPlease keep sending me ideas and suggestions, help keep this blog alive.\nAutomating the ebook sale made things a lot easier too. You no longer need to wait for me to check my mail to send you the ebook. It's all automated. I no longer receive that many angry mails from blog readers who are waiting for me to send them the pieces.\nI've been on a break of sort since November. In between jobs would be a better description haha. I'm definitely looking forward to starting work at my new workplace in January. It's a small office, there would not be any adventures there that's for sure.\nIt's pretty challenging to keep myself occupied for 2 months, the initial period took a bit of adjusting to. My family knew of the situation but not the extend of it. They were aware of the job change but not of the 2 months break, so November was pretty much spent trying to put up a front that all was normal.\nI just don't want them to worry for me.\nSo, like a typical drama, i would dress up for work as usual, maybe head out a bit later on pretext of having a meeting before heading to a library or a cafe for a few hours of writing. What follows would be some light reading while i try to get in touch with friends i haven't caught up with for a while.\nI met many of them for lunch, some for dinner and drinks, it seems quite a few of them are affected by the state of the economy as well. Pay cut is the norm, many consider themselves lucky to even hold on to their jobs. A few unlucky ones took to driving to tide things through until a offer comes along.\nGenerally as a whole, although things may appear a little gloomy, it's not the end of the world.\nMost of my classmates and army mates are still doing ok. We still have food on the table and a roof over our heads. Everyone is healthy, that's all that matters.\nWe talked about the old carefree days in school, our dreams and laughed over a few beers in the coffeeshop. Beer, fingerfood and a few good friends to chat with, life's good when things are simple.\nOne particular friend, Terry, asked me what is my dream.\nI hesitated for quite a while as i thought about my answer.\nTerry shook his finger at me and said just one.\nTerry : Dream.... that only one... the one you work towards.... what do you really want ??\nHe went on to give me a short lecture of working towards my dream.\nYou would probably expect Terry to be some motivational speaker or educator but he's not. He's actually a plumber/electrician. His dad taught him the trade after poly, father and son then continued the 2 man company.\nThey're making good money by the way. It's backbreaking and sweaty work but once you establish yourself in the trade, you only need to service a few contractors and designers and you're set.\nSo while thinking about my dream, i asked Terry the same question.\nWhat dream can a plumber have you say ?\nWhile the rest of our class spent the better of the decade working for others, Terry spent the same amount of time working for himself. He's stashed away a good amount of savings and built up a sizable portfolio of stocks.\nDue to get married soon, Terry already has the financial muscle to pay off his HDB BTO in full if he wishes to with plenty to spare. He planned to take a 3 month break and travel with his wife after their wedding. He's been saving for this for a while and planning the exact route and itinerary took close to a year.\nIs that his dream then ? To travel with his wife.\nIt is his dream, for now... according to him..... before he starts working towards the next one.\nTerry : So which one are you working towards now ??\nI would have love to tell him about this blog and my love for writing but i can't so i said i would love to travel too after much hesitation.\nSeeing me hesitate, Terry added that actually it doesn't matter what dream it is.\nAs long as you wake up everyday and you work towards it.\nJames : you should go and become a motivational speaker..\nWe switched topics after than but what he said stuck with me for a few days. It really is as simple as it gets.\nWake up, do your stuff and at the end of that day, ask yourself one question.\nDid i get 1 brick in or 1 step closer to my dream ?\nA simple yes and no answer.\nNo ? Then do something about it.\nUsing this year as a benchmark, i think getting 2 full length work our a year seemed doable as long as i have the materials for it.\nAside from My hawker adventures, i shall work towards getting another piece up for the 2nd half of 2017.\nEventually, maybe in a decade or so, i may have enough works to publish a book ? haha. Imagine the day finally comes when our libraries has a real ' adult' section accessible by above '21s' .\nI look forward to the day when i can write full time , not for a living but as a hobby.\nA distant dream but i'm working towards it.\n2016 is the year of the monkey, geomancers say it's a year of mischief and disruption, with the approaching 2017, i hope the arrival of the rooster would herald a new dawn for all of us.\nDoesn't matter what 2016 has thrown at you, you're still here.\nI wish all blog visitors a happy, healthy and prosperous 2017.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T14:15:35Z\",\"url\":\"http://sensualsingapore.blogspot.com/2016/12/wrapping-up-2016.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

Certainly felt like it was time for one and I went hunting for a photo to use, and this one generated the story I put into the caption setting.\nMy GF is plus size, so I can certainly understand the confusion as many stores, especially Target, tend to place the maternity clothing right next to the \"women's\" or \"ladies\" section.

A few different captions starring the model currently in the featured post in the right hand column. One deals with a special furry blanket, and the other with .. Disney Princesses!\nI like it. Nice, subtle progression - nothing overt or shocking, just an awakening almost.\nAs for personal stuff, be strong, know we're all here for you, and take some pressure off. If you can't caption for a few days, we'll all understand.\nThanks! I am not even sure who/how he was changed. Was it his wife doing it as a punishment, or the sales clerk thinking the outfit was for him, or that only the person the clothes were for could return the blouse at that store?\nThe irony of all this is I was picturing the story happening at a Marshall's and I'm pretty sure that they don't have a Maternity Rack.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T02:35:33Z\",\"url\":\"http://deelusionsofgrandeur.blogspot.com/2018/04/a-rookie-mistake-no-husband-should-make.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"The BJP's Trivendra Singh Rawat, who had been a long-time RSS pracharak, will take oath as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand today. Mr Rawat, who had worked closely with party chief Amit Shah during the 2014 national election, has many years of experience as a minister. His name was proposed by BJP leader Prakash Pant and seconded by Satpal Maharaj - the two BJP men were also in the race for the post. Mr Rawat will be sworn in as Uttarakhand Chief Minister today at Dehradun's Parade Ground. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are scheduled to attend the swearing-in ceremony. Mr Rawat will be the ninth Chief Minister of the hill state. After Mr Pant and Mr Maharaj's prooposal, the remaining 54 Bharatiya Janata Party legislators unanimously approved Mr Rawat's candidature.\nA former associate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trivendra Rawat was Agriculture Minister in the previous BJP government in Uttarakhand, which was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.\nAddressing the media yesterday, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, \"Trivendra Singh Rawat has been elected as the leader of the BJP Legislature Party. The proposal was accepted unanimously.\" Mr Tomar also said that Mr Rawat later met Governor Krishan Kant Paul and staked claim to form the new government. The BJP has won 57 of Uttarkhand's 70 seats in a total rout of the Congress, which ruled the state for the last five year.\nElected from Doiwala, where he defeated Congress' Hira Singh Bisht with a margin of over 24,000 votes, Mr Rawat is widely regarded in the party for his organisational skills. Besides being closely associated with Narendra Modi when he was a BJP General Secretary, Mr Rawat also worked with Amit Shah as his deputy in Uttar Pradesh during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. That was when the BJP and its ally Apna Dal created history by sweeping 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.\nMr Rawat, a Thakur, is largely credited with the BJP win in Jharkhand where he oversaw the party's assembly elections in 2014.\nMr Rawat will be the fifth BJP chief minister in Uttarakhand. The party formed its first government in the state when it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000 with Nityanand Swami as the first Chief Minister.\nThe first challenge that stares Uttarakhand chief minister-designate Trivendra Singh Rawat in the face is how to chose his Cabinet with a number of newly-elected party MLAs eyeing ministerial berths. Though there is no word officially from the BJP yet on the ministers to be sworn-in along with the chief minister today, quite a few names are doing the rounds, including those of Yashpal Arya, Satpal Maharaj, Harak Singh Rawat, Harbans Kapoor, Madan Kaushik, Munna Singh Chauhan, Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, Subodh Uniyal and Rekha Arya.\nSorting out the issue may be a tricky affair for Mr Rawat, as the limit for the size of the Cabinet is only 12 including the chief minister, and aspirants for ministerial berths are far too many including old party loyalists as well as the Congress turncoats who were ministers in Harish Rawat's Cabinet and won this time on BJP tickets.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T20:13:12Z\",\"url\":\"https://watsupptoday.com/slider/2457\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"Shaking my head as usual at the headlines and poor excuses for news, Wednesday's trumped-up report that Bernie Sanders booster Neil Young \"excused\" Donald Trump for using \"Rockin' In The Free World\" turned out to be a non-starter and almost as out of context as the right appropriating rock 'n' roll for their own diabolical purposes. If you remember last year around this time, non-voting Canadian but Californian Young asked that Trump not use the song during his campaign, and that was the end of that. Young, to his credit, joined the long line of rock 'n' roll heroes from Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, and John Mellencamp who just said no to their music being misappropriated by the real forces of evil. We have indeed been over this territory a few times before and there was no news here.\nA righteous pundit, Wainwright has been pursuing music since the late sixties, debuting with a self-titled album in 1970. Aside from his honest and deeply felt songs on relationships and life circumstances, he's long written satirical work, a style he calls \"musical journalism\" and is best demonstrated at album length on 1999's Social Studies (he gives it to O.J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, and Helms). For awhile he was the in-house songsmith for Nightline and is occasionally commissioned songs for NPR. Ol' Loudo, as he sometimes calls himself, originally hails from Helms territory; dad Loudon Wainwright Jr., was a columnist for Life magazine, while the name Loudon comes from A. Loudon Snowdon, a 19th Century politico who was Loudon III's great-grandfather. Wainwright is also father to musical children Rufus and Martha Wainwright (their mother was folksinger Kate McGarrigle), and Lucy Wainwright Roche, whose mother is Suzzy Roche of the Roches. Wainwright's also pursued acting through the decades and his film and television credits, often comedic, are mighty, from M.A.S.H to Judd Apatow's Knocked Up.\nWainwright's 23rd studio album, Haven't Got The Blues Yet, was produced by longtime collaborator David Mansfield, and released in 2014, though some still remember him best from the novelty, \"Dead Skunk (In The Middle of the Road),\" a Top 40 hit in 1972. Interestingly, that was the same year rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry had a number one record with \"My Ding-A-Ling.\" And it was of course the year of Richard Nixon began his ill-fated second term. You might say it's a coincidence that Wainwright nailed the exact moment in time where the listening public lost all discernment, the world went to hell in a hand basket, and the door was opened for us to march toward the time when a buffoon might win the presidency. But I'm not foolish enough to make that claim. I'm simply suggesting it.\nDenise Sullivan writes about music and gentrification issues from San Francisco for DWT.

{"text":"This article is about the German title. For other uses, see Führer (disambiguation).\nFührer (German pronunciation: [ˈfyːʁɐ], spelled Fuehrer when the umlaut is not available) is a German word meaning \"leader\" or \"guide\". As a political title it is associated with the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Nazi Germany cultivated the Führerprinzip (\"leader principle\"), and Hitler was generally known as just der Führer (\"the Leader\").\nFührer was the title demanded by Adolf Hitler to denote his function as the head of the Nazi Party; he received it in 1921 when, infuriated over party founder Anton Drexler's plan to merge with another antisemitic far-right nationalist party, he resigned from the party. Drexler and the party's Executive Committee then acquiesced to Hitler's demand to be made the chairman of the party with \"dictatorial powers\" as the condition for his return. It was common at the time to refer to leaders of all sorts, including those of political parties, as Führer. Hitler's adoption of the title was partly inspired by its earlier use by the Austrian Georg von Schönerer, a major exponent of pan-Germanism and German nationalism in Austria, whose followers commonly referred to him as the Führer, and who also used the Roman salute – where the right arm and hand are held rigidly outstretched – which they called the \"German greeting\". According to historian Richard J. Evans, this use of \"Führer\" by Schönerer's Pan-German Association, probably introduced the term to the German far right, but its specific adoption by the Nazis may have been influenced by the use in Italy of \"Duce\", also meaning \"leader\", as an informal title for Benito Mussolini, the Fascist Prime Minister, and later dictator, of that country.\nAfter Hitler's appointment as Reichskanzler (Chancellor of the Reich) the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act which allowed Hitler's cabinet to promulgate laws by decree.\nOne day before the death of Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler and his cabinet decreed a law that merged the office of the president with that of Chancellor, so that Hitler became Führer and Reichskanzler – although eventually Reichskanzler was quietly dropped. Hitler therefore assumed the President's powers without assuming the office itself – ostensibly out of respect for Hindenburg's achievements as a heroic figure in World War I. Though this law was in breach of the Enabling Act, which specifically precluded any laws concerning the Presidential office, it was approved by a referendum on 19 August.\nHitler saw himself as the sole source of power in Germany, similar to the Roman emperors and German medieval leaders. He used the title Führer und Reichskanzler (Leader and Chancellor), highlighting the positions he already held in party and government, though in popular reception, the element Führer was increasingly understood not just in reference to the Nazi Party, but also in reference to the German people and the German state. Soldiers had to swear allegiance to Hitler as \"Führer des deutschen Reiches und Volkes\" (Leader of the German Reich and People). The title was changed on 28 July 1942 to \"Führer des Großdeutschen Reiches\" (Leader of the Greater German Reich). In his political testament, Hitler also referred to himself as Führer der Nation (Leader of the Nation).\nOne of the Nazis' most-repeated political slogans was Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer – \"One People, One Empire, One Leader\". Bendersky says the slogan \"left an indelible mark on the minds of most Germans who lived through the Nazi years. It appeared on countless posters and in publications; it was heard constantly in radio broadcasts and speeches.\" The slogan emphasized the absolute control of the party over practically every sector of German society and culture – with the churches being the most notable exception. Hitler's word was absolute, but he had a narrow range of interest – mostly involving diplomacy and the military – and so his subordinates interpreted his will to fit their own interests.\nAccording to the Constitution of Weimar, the President was Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Unlike \"President\", Hitler did take this title (Oberbefehlshaber) for himself. When conscription was reintroduced in 1935, Hitler created the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, a post held by the Minister for War. He retained the title of Supreme Commander for himself. Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, then the Minister of War and one of those who created the Hitler oath, or the personal oath of loyalty of the military to Hitler, became the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces while Hitler remained Supreme Commander. Following the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair in 1938, Hitler assumed the commander-in-chief's post as well and took personal command of the armed forces. However, he continued using the older formally higher title of Supreme Commander, which was thus filled with a somewhat new meaning. Combining it with \"Führer\", he used the style Führer und Oberster Befehlshaber der Wehrmacht (Leader and Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht), yet a simple \"Führer\" since May 1942.\nAn additional title was adopted by Hitler on 23 June 1941 when he declared himself the \"Germanic Führer\" (Germanischer Führer), in addition to his duties as Führer of the German state and people. This was done to emphasize Hitler's professed leadership of what the Nazis described as the \"Nordic-Germanic master race\", which was considered to include peoples such as the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Dutch, and others in addition to the Germans, and the intent to annex these countries to the German Reich in 1933. Waffen-SS formations from these countries had to declare obedience to Hitler by addressing him in this fashion. On 12 December 1941 the Dutch fascist Anton Mussert also addressed him as such when he proclaimed his allegiance to Hitler during a visit to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. He had wanted to address Hitler as Führer aller Germanen (\"Führer of all Germanics\"), but Hitler personally decreed the former style. Historian Loe de Jong speculates on the difference between the two: Führer aller Germanen implied a position separate from Hitler's role as Führer und Reichskanzler des Grossdeutschen Reiches (\"Führer and Reich Chancellor of the Greater German Empire\"), while germanischer Führer served more as an attribute of that main function. As late as 1944, however, occasional propaganda publications continued to refer to him by this unofficial title.\nFührer has been used as a military title (compare Latin Dux) in Germany since at least the 18th century. The usage of the term \"Führer\" in the context of a company-sized military subunit in the German Army referred to a commander lacking the qualifications for permanent command. For example, the commanding officer of a company was (and is) titled \"Kompaniechef\" (literally, Company Chief), but if he did not have the requisite rank or experience, or was only temporarily assigned to command, he was officially titled \"Kompanieführer\". Thus operational commands of various military echelons were typically referred to by their formation title followed by the title Führer, in connection with mission-type tactics used by the German military forces. The term Führer was also used at lower levels, regardless of experience or rank; for example, a Gruppenführer was the leader of a squad of infantry (9 or 10 men).\nUnder the Nazis, the title Führer was also used in paramilitary titles (see Freikorps). Almost every Nazi paramilitary organization, in particular the SS and SA, had Nazi party paramilitary ranks incorporating the title of Führer. The SS including the Waffen-SS, like all paramilitary Nazi organisations, called all their members of any degree except the lowest Führer of something; thus confusingly, Gruppenführer was also an official rank title for a specific grade of general. The word Truppenführer was also a generic word referring to any commander or leader of troops, and could be applied to NCOs or officers at many different levels of command.\nThe word Führerstand translates to a \"driver's cab\"\nIn Germany, the isolated word \"Führer\" is usually avoided in political contexts, due to its intimate connection with Nazi institutions and with Hitler personally. However, the term -führer is used in many compound words. Examples include Bergführer (mountain guide), Fremdenführer (tourist guide), Geschäftsführer (CEO or EO), Führerschein (driver's license), Führerstand or Führerhaus (driver's cab), Lok(omotiv)führer (train driver), Reiseführer (travel guide book), and Spielführer (team captain — also referred to as Mannschaftskapitän).\nThe use of alternative terms like \"Chef\" (a borrowing from the French, as is the English \"chief\", e.g. Chef des Bundeskanzleramtes) or Leiter (often in compound words like Amtsleiter, Projektleiter or Referatsleiter) is usually not the result of replacing of the word \"Führer\", but rather using terminology that existed before the Nazis. The use of Führer to refer to a political party leader is rare today and Vorsitzender (chairman) is the more common term. However, the word Oppositionsführer (\"leader of the (parliamentary) opposition\") is more commonly used.\n^ \"Means Used by the Nazi Conspiractors in Gaining Control of the German State (Part 4 of 55)\".\n^ Evans, Richard J.

{"text":"graphic novel, Maus, by depicting a Jewish minority as mice, victimized by anti-semitic cats.\nAn American Tail makes no point of the essential Jewishness of the Mousekewitz family, but treats them simply as part of the wave of European immigrants that swept over America in the 19th century (but depicted as funny animals). Fievel, their young son, represents the first generation of such immigrants — the ones who were born in the Old World, but grew up in America.\nFievel's voice was provided by Philip Glasser (who later did the voice of one of Bebe's Kids). Those doing the voices of Papa and Mama, Nehemiah Persoff and Erica Yohn respectively, had no other roles in animation, but extensive credits as face actors. Others heard include Dom DeLuise (also heard in The Secret of NIMH and All Dogs Go to Heaven), Madeline Kahn (A Bug's Life), Pat Musick (also in Duckman and The Tick) and Hal Smith (Davey & Goliath).\nThe Mousekewitz family story continued in An American Tale: Fievel Goes West (1991), in which the family continues its migration westward; and in a Saturday morning TV series, which lasted only one season. Two more feature-length films were made, but they went straight to video.\nThe two features, and the Fievel character in particular, were heavily merchandised, profitably so. To date, however, they have spawned no monthly comic books, no daily newspaper strips, no Big Little Books. But the films themselves have proved popular in the video market, so Fievel's story isn't over yet.\nText ©2000-10 Donald D. Markstein.

{"text":"Inclusive finance is one of the most focused on issues for the Chinese government this year. In January, authorities issued a five-year plan for the development of inclusive finance in the country, and since then, the term has appeared multiple times in government reports and is still gaining traction.\nThe concept is simple. There is an enormous rural population in China, as well as blue-collar workers and other lower income citizens spread throughtout the country. These groups are badly in need of banking services and financing, be it for crop insurance in farming regions or access to loans to buy seeds for growing, or sending their children for higher education. The need for financing is equally urgent in cities, where nearly 20 million SMEs (small medium enterprises) in China are searching for capital to expand. These groups have traditionally been underserved by banks.\nThe Chinese government has recognized Fintech as a viable solution to solve this issue, and is eagerly encouraging this digital transformation. During a conference in Shanghai last month, chiefs from PBOC (People’s Bank of China), NIFA (National Internet Finance Association of China) praised the development of Fintech on the Mainland and promised more support for Inclusive Finance.\nThe government support is a push in the right direction. Financial institutions typically focus on the top 20% of wealthy consumers who control 80% of the country’s wealth. The financial inclusion market is considered a blue ocean. Even so, difficulties such as the lack of credit records and the high cost of going rural have always put big financial institutions off. Fortunately, the development of the internet and other similar technologies is transforming the space.\nFinancial affiliates of established players such as Credit Ease, Ant Financial, and JingDong Finance are already moving into inclusive finance. Alibaba’s Mybank said it would offer smaller loans than regular banks and focus on the everyday 'man-on-the-street' and SMEs. Yirendai.com under Credit Ease considers inclusive finance as a social responsibility.\nGuangzhou-based PPmoney.com is one of China’s most used online wealth management and lending platforms. Their client focus includes blue-collar workers in China. On the asset side of the platform, PPmoney has developed four products for their customers: mortgage for 3C (Computer, Communication, Consumer Electronics) products, mortgages for vehicles, leasing for trucks, and cash loans.\nThe firm also developed a new risk management system that includes four core elements: Cloud approval, Robot learning, Big data and Anti-fraud. At a recent forum, Baoguo Chen, the CEO of PPmoney.com, who is also the official at Guangdong Internet Finance Association, urged banks and financial institutions to support innovation in banking to assist the low-income population.\nCashbus is another good example of a startup focusing on micro cash loans. It provides small loans for clients in need of cash for a short period before getting their monthly salaries. They created an efficient credit checking process to quickly approval a loan and satisfy borrower’s urgent money needs. Borrowers need not hand the company any collateral and can take out loans with by just providing their identification card and a cellphone number. The loans are approved in 20 minutes.\nShould the firms above succeed, the development of inclusive banking services in the rural areas China is set to witness big change.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T15:53:06Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.kapronasia.com/china-capital-markets-research-category/developments-in-inclusive-finance-in-china.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

Taekwondo is a dramatic and attractive style; it has become an Olympic sport due to the interest in its dynamic moves and is fascinating to watch for spectators. It calls for incredible flexibility and strength and many of the techniques revolve around incredible kicks. In fact, Taekwondo is not about punching techniques at all, its focus is all about evolving the sport itself and the power through the legs.\nWhen buying a Taekwondo uniform, the dynamic style of the martial art must be taken into equation. Because the martial arts student will need to be able to move quickly and confidently and with great flexibility, it is essential that the suit does not restrict at all. A poorly made suit will not stand up to the test of time and although suits can be reasonably priced, it would be pointless, time consuming and expensive if having to constantly replace the uniform. Martial artists who wish to feel confident and to progress within the sport, should invest in the best quality suit that is available.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T06:32:16Z\",\"url\":\"http://softconstructors.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&p=1544\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"5 Things You Should Know About \"Stranger Things 2\" Star Dacre Montgomery!\nOkay, if you have seen \"Stranger Things\", you’re probably not a big fan of Max’s older step-brother Billy. His constant aggression and bullying just isn’t our vibe. Lucky for us, though, Billy is just a fictional character being portrayed by the very talented, young Aussie actor Dacre Montgomery, and we are definitely here for that! Dacre joined Season 2 of the hit Netflix show after submitting his very vibrant and hilarious audition tape, which earned him the role of Billy, and he hasn't looked back since.\nThere is so much going for the 23-year-old heartthrob, and we just want to know more! Here are four facts to know about our boy Dacre!\n1. His Name is Pronounced \"DAY-ker\"\nEven we admit to flubbing it at first; Dacre is more commonly seen as a last name, with French origins (more on that below), but with the rising popularity of \"Stranger Things\" and the actor, maybe we'll start seeing more babies being named Dacre!\nYup, you read it right! Our boy was the Red Power Ranger in the 2017 film reboot. His character, Jason, was the leader of the gang and managed their activities throughout all of their world-saving endeavours. His responsible, courageous, and charming on-screen performance was no less than perfect, obviously. He soon became the leader of the hearts of every teen in the Power Ranger fandom. Go, go, Dacre Power Ranger!\nAs much as he loves to act, Dacre also has a true passion for interior design. Judging from his Instagram posts, he is very much as artsy as he is theatrical. His fashion statements and overall personality show a different side to him that we can’t help but love. He is able to show his style through his posts and his outfits, and we are forever grateful. You know what they say, Instagram posts speak louder than words!\nAlthough we already adore him like we adore the royal family, our adoration comes with good reason. Dacre may very well be referred to as “his royal highness” -- He is descended from Charles II of England (1630-1685), who was King of Great Britain way back in the 17th Century and was known for his loyal patronage to arts and sciences. Dacre's name derives from his mother’s side, whose ancestry includes the Barons Dacre of England. So… all hail Lord Dacre?\nApart from conquering the TV world one role at a time, Dacre was one of the leads in Angus and Julia Stone’s music video. His outdoorsy, adventurous personality definitely earned some him McDreamy points. The music videos follows a young adult couple going on an adventure, and it may very well be the sweetest thing we have ever seen. All we do is sit in jealousy but continue to support him!\nWhen push comes to shove, we’ll always show Dacre love. With a new movie featuring Russell Crowe in the works, and the confirmation of a third season of \"Stranger Things\", we can only expect that he shines to the fullest and we cannot wait to see what cool, eccentric performances he has in store for us!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T04:33:25Z\",\"url\":\"https://younghollywood.com/scene/5-things-you-should-know-about-stranger-things-2-star-dacre-montgomery.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Justin Marks is preparing to make his Daytona 500 debut on Feb. 18 (2:30 p.m. ET, FOX) and as far as first-timers go, there may be no driver more prepared for this great step in his career.\nIt is one of many great steps – figuratively and literally – Justin Marks has made … and will make. This year, he’ll take the green flag for the Daytona 500. Next year, he hopes to plant a flag near the summit of Mount Everest.\nTypically, people find race car drivers bold and adventurous. In this case, the race car drivers find Marks the one who is bold and adventurous.\n“That’s insane to me,’’ NASCAR driver Kyle Larson said of his good friend Marks’ pursuit of the world’s tallest mountain. “We fly airplanes at 35,000 feet in the air and that Everest peak is what, 29,000 feet?\n“It’s really fascinating and neat to know someone who’s going to attempt to climb Mount Everest one day.\nOnly a month ago, Marks was climbing Aconcagua in the Andes Mountains – reaching 21,900 feet, just a few hundred feet short of a stormy summit, unsafe to venture in those conditions. And that experience was literally days before arriving in Daytona Beach to race an Acura in the Rolex 24 At Daytona.\n“It’s been kind of crazy,’’ Marks conceded with a slight laugh. “I was preseason testing at the Roar (Before the 24) the first week of January. I drove the first session on Friday, the first time I’d been in that IMSA car, then got out of the race car and went straight to my rental car and drove to the Orlando airport. Then I flew 18 hours to Mendoza, Argentina, then drove three hours up into Provincial Park and took a helicopter to base camp.\nAnd the frenetic pace only continues for Justin Marks, who will drive the No. 51 Chevrolet Camaro for Rick Ware Racing in conjunction with Premium Motorsports in the Daytona 500. The team – which is also fielding a car for Danica Patrick – has a guaranteed starting spot as Rick Ware Racing has leased a charter.\n“Obviously it’s a dream, a bucket list thing,’’ Marks said. “I’ve been racing for 20 years and I’m kinda like at the point where I want to do these amazing races that are the flagship events in the sport I love.\n“I tried to make a race a few years ago and missed it. I’ve tried to get back ever since and it’s the Daytona 500. It’s the biggest event in our sport.\n“I remember I went there as a kid, I watched on TV, I remember ditching school in eighth grade to go watch the Gatorade Duels. So being a part of it is a huge deal. I’m in a good car with a good group of people and we’ll be well-prepared for the event.\nIt will be Justin Marks’ fourth career start in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and second superspeedway green flag. Marks owns a NASCAR Xfinity Series trophy, won on a rainy Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course driving for Chip Ganassi in 2016.\nAnd while Marks said he still hopes to compete in several NASCAR events in 2018, he will be competing full-time in IMSA driving the No. 93 Acura NSX GT3 for Michael Shank Racing. For the driver who currently calls northern California home, it will be the first full season of racing since 2010 when he competed in the ARCA Series, winning at Palm Beach, Florida, and earning a pole position and 13 top-10 finishes in 20 races.\nRacing for Justin Marks has been a diverse and very personal pursuit – as you may expect from someone who has shown us all how great the rewards are when you dare to dream big.\n“He’s had very successful businesses that way and his racing endeavors have been successful as well,’’ his friend Larson said. “He’s kind of had some things he dreams about and wants to do. And does them.\nMarks concedes that he’s always been a “think big” type of person. The first triathlon he entered was an Ironman. The first running race he competed in wasn’t a local 10K, it was an ultra-marathon.\nSo, of course, Mount Everest is a logical goal for Marks. He has been training, in a sense, for years and upped the focus and physical challenge in the last year as he begins a true push to summit the world’s tallest mountain.\nThe mindset necessary to accomplish this is interesting, compelling and crucial. It is what separates those of us who might dream of climbing Everest and those, like Marks, who actually plan to do it.\n“It’s such a unique challenge, such a mental challenge,’’ Marks said. “It’s a mental challenge going through these long training runs and training for months and months before you even go to the mountain then challenging when you’re on the mountain. Not only is it challenging to climb and the physical work, but it’s hard just being there.\n“It’s hard to go through the daily routine of life – cooking food, packing, moving camp and inventorying, of rationing clean clothes and trying to keep everything dry, just everything else besides the climbing – that’s all hard work, too.\nMarks says the preparation for racing – even in IMSA’s grueling endurance races such as the Rolex 24 or 12 Hours of Sebring – benefits from his Everest training.\nLast month Marks was heading toward a mountain summit. In the next week, he will push toward a racing goal – competing in NASCAR’s biggest event, the Daytona 500. Mount Everest, he’s coming your way next year.\n“I think a lot of people are into it, a lot are living kind of vicariously through it because it’s adventure,’’ Marks acknowledged of the interest in his climbing.\n“I think everybody kind of has it in them, everybody has a desire to do something, especially in the racing community which is such a unique life for all of us anyway.\n“A lot of people ‘get it.’ They’re enthralled by it because they’re all kind of adventurous people. But a lot more people follow it than I thought would, so that’s made it important to me to share as much as I can on social media as possible.\nIt is a strong lesson in what seizing the day can mean – and that’s an idea that any of us can appreciate and learn from.\n“I will tell you, setting these big, audacious goals and then training for them and pushing yourself outside your comfort zone like that, it really changes your perspective on a lot of things in life,’’ Marks said. “I mean, when you go through an experience like that (climbing a mountain), it makes a lot more in life appear attainable.\n“You look at things and say, ‘that’s a dream’ or ‘that’s a goal’ or ‘I’d love to do that some day.’ For me, personally, going through the process of mountain climbing, I look at all those things not as dreams, goals or ‘some days’ but just as something I can go work for.\n“It’s just work – making the decision rather than dreaming about it or hanging a picture on the wall. It’s just a matter of thinking about it methodically, of saying I want to go do that so I’ll figure out what the process is.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T12:32:03Z\",\"url\":\"https://michaelsmeriglioracing.com/justin-marks-summit-daytona-500/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":">>> as anne just mentioned this oil is devastating people who live along the gulf coast among them residents of plaquemines parish . billy nungesser is the parish president . i know you're hearing it from the people who live in that parish. give me the sense of the range of emotions you're hearing on a daily basis.\n>> it's fear. it's disgust. it's -- you know, people in plaquemines parish aren't used to sitting around and waiting. we prepare for the worst and hope for the best. and we just don't see the efforts out there, number one. we told them it would come ashore. they said, no, it will be a few tar balls. it's come ashore. they're not equipped. there's no plan in place. the leadership is really lacking from all aspects of the coast guard and bp . seven skimmer boats in plack plaquemines parish as you see it takes them four or five days to get out there. it's just unacceptable. the people are disgusted, frustrated, as i am. and putting more troops on the ground is not the answer. we need a leader to step up and take charge and build this berm out there that the keep most of the oil out.\n>> mr. nungesser, would you say the frustration level is equal or equally shared between the federal government and bp or are the people in that area blaming one over the other?\n>> well, i think we're pointing the finger at both and they keep pointing the finger at each other. and the coast guard ultimately has the decision. they can direct bp to do anything. had they directed them to pay and build this berm 30 days ago, we would have over 20 miles of berm out the water receiving this oil on the beach. it's easy to clean it up off the beaches. you won't clean it up out of the marshes where it's destroying the habitat for the pelicans and all the wildlife in louisiana. it will destroy it for many years. and we told them that. it's now coming ashore. they need to admit they made a mistake, take a step back and let's get working out there, pull all stops out to protect our coastline. but they're still pointing the finger. more people on the ground is not the answer. organization, the equipment and building that berm to protect our coastline is the answer. we need to pull out all stops.\n>> we've got the memorial day weekend fast approaching here, mr. nungesser. obviously the traditional start to the tourism season. what impact are you expecting?\n>> all the tournaments, all the big fishing tournaments are canceled. all the festivals in this area have been canceled. we have no tourism. all we have is the workers here that are working on this spill. and it's pretty devastating. and we're talking about long, long-lasting effects in these marshlands. i'm so disappointed they won't spend $300 million to build a barrier island to protect us but i heard yesterday bp put up $500 million to check and research and study what's going to happen after the fact. we're not going to need that money because there's not going to be much left here to study. put that money up front. let's save the marsh while we still have a chance. we lost the battle. we haven't lost the war. it's time for a true leader to step up and let's make something happen.\n>> all right. plaquemines parish president billy nungesser. thank you for your time and our thoughts are with all of the good folks in your parish.\n>>> 7:12. once again here's meredith.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-22T17:14:34Z\",\"url\":\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37337727/ns/disaster_in_the_gulf/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"I made this functioning neuron that uses a stacks of blocks as analogs to sodium and potassium ions to simulate an action potential in minecraft. I only included sodium and potassium in this model.\nGold pressure plate can be thought of as a binding site for neurotransmitters. As the number of sprites released from dropper grows, the signal from plate increases. The quantity of items in chest determines the threshold for stimulation.\nOnce the \"neurotransmitters have bound,\" the torch will be extinguished, and the hoppers they power will be able to draw \"ions\" from the chest.\nThe box on the left represents the extracellular concentration of sodium (initially high). Stacks will be drawn out and \"diffuse\" into the intracellular chest.\nto maintain a resting potential, we compare the stacks in our intracellular chest to a chest that has the desired intracellular concentration. if the value is too high, the hopper below the chest is powered and items will be drawn out to be pumped against their concentration back to the extracellular chest.\nThis is the sodium/potassium pump i use to move blocks back across the \"membrane.\" the chest contains \"ATP.\" While the chest outputs a signal, the ATP is used up by the hopper beneath. Once ATP reaches a critical concentration, there will be no signal. On the other side, the chest's signal is used to start as small clock of my own desgin http://redd.it/1amnqf. this pulse is used to drive the droppers that act to pump ions.\nthese droppers simply carry the excess intracellular ions back across the \"membrane\" to the extracellular chest. I use pistons extending redstone blocks to power most of them.\nThe two comparators to the far left come from the chest for intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium. (potassium has the same exact mechanism as the sodium channel, but the potassium starts with more on the INSIDE.) The signals are compared to give total \"voltage.\" for low voltages,the sodium pump will be promoted and potassium pump suppressed. (this is not necessarily the case in real life, but to get a similar response this must be done.) At a certain voltage, the reverse will be true.\nonce the membrane voltage reaches its maximum, the piston extends the redstone for a few ticks to activate the same clock shown earlier. This clock cause the release of \"neurotransmitters\" from the dropper. I elected to not use Calcium ions because they would only mean more channels/pumps. The cycle repeats itself. chain em up for some fun.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T11:26:53Z\",\"url\":\"https://imgur.com/a/09Hf3\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"If you are tying the knot soon, don’t forget to express your gratitude towards your girls. Consider gifting them jewelry that will forever remind them of your big day and the enjoyable time they had.\nHowever, picking pieces of jewelry that look good with the bridesmaid ensemble can be challenging. Use the tips shared in this post to surprise your bridesmaids with the most fascinating pieces of ornaments.\nEach of your bridesmaids is a different person; hence, the jewelry you choose for them may not necessarily be the same. Though your favorite girls are willing to comply with your wedding theme and budget, it is a good idea to consider their personal style when gifting them a personal accessory like jewelry.\nFor instance, if your wedding color palette is cyan, and one of your bridesmaids likes wearing bespoke Indian wedding jewelry, consider gifting her Indian-style earrings or bracelets with turquoise gemstones. Keep the turquoise factor common for all the bridesmaids to maintain a unified look. Experiment with different jewelry designs based on their preference, enabling them to showcase their individualistic personalities.\nPay close attention to your bridesmaids’ dressing style. If you decide to gift them a necklace, consider a style that matches their gown’s neckline. For instance, if your girls are wearing a plunging neckline, a pendant necklace will look great. Similarly, double-stranded necklaces, chokers, or chunky pearl necklaces complement strapless gowns with wide necklines.\nIf your bridesmaids have diverse preferences, ask them to wear their own designer jewelry and complement it with a pair of coordinated stud earrings or statement bracelets gifted by you. These ornaments will beautifully complement their attire, creating a unique look that works together aesthetically.\nThe trinkets you gift your bridesmaids will always remain with them. Make this gift memorable by buying them a piece of versatile and understated jewelry that they can wear with any attire.\nExercise caution when investing in jewelry that is in trend as they may become obsolete in a few years. Find ornaments that are chic and timeless as these will make them think of you whenever they wear them.\nThe maid of honor (most probably the bride’s BFF) is the chief bridesmaid who lends a helping hand throughout the wedding preparations and celebrations, hosts the bridal shower, and delegates responsibilities to other bridesmaids.\nSince your maid of honor will be playing a central role in your wedding, it is only fair to reflect her status by making her trinkets more special than the rest. You may choose to give her a matching set of earrings with the necklace that you are gifting your entire girl gang. Alternatively, you can gift her a trinket made of a different metal or gemstone, making her stand out from the rest.\nWhen investing in wedding jewelry, work with a jeweler or shop online to gift your maid of honor the most suitable piece of jewelry that she will appreciate for life.\nJewelry is meant to express one’s personality. No wonder, customized jewelry is a growing trend in the fashion domain. Personalized jewelry makes a thoughtful gift as it helps you express your fondness and gratitude towards your loved ones.\nMoreover, since they are custom-made to the wearer’s preferences, you know that they will be appreciated and worn forever. For instance, the type of metals and gemstones people prefer in their jewelry can be polarizing. Some people prefer sterling silver or platinum, whereas others like gold. Being aware of these preferences will go a long way in creating an ornament that reflects the wearer’s personality.\nChoose your bridesmaids’ favorite precious metals or birthstones and create customized blings that they can flaunt on your wedding day and all the special occasions that follow.\nAlternatively, you can get their names, initials, or birthdate engraved on bracelets or pendants to create a signature accessory that they will cherish forever.\nFinally, before wrapping the gift, remember to add a personal note to show your appreciation towards them.\nAfter all the time and effort they have invested in making your wedding a hit, your bridal party deserves something exquisite. Express gratitude towards your happy and supportive bridesmaids by gifting them timeless pieces of jewelry that they will wear for years to come.\nUse the information shared in this post when you shop for some gorgeous and timeless jewels for your bridesmaids. Your squad will surely appreciate this gesture!\nPuja Shah, Co-Founder & Creative head at Aurus, is a qualified jewelry designer from FIT, New York.

{"text":"Thank you for volunteering, Caroline!\nMany thanks to Caroline Latta for choosing Rescued Pets Movement as the subject of her Girl Scouts community service project! Not only did she explain what RPM does and talk about the importance of fostering with many members of her community, but she also made enrichment toys for the dogs and cats in our program, which you can find in the toy box Caroline made in our clinic lobby. Caroline sent the two tutorial videos below that show how you can make the toys for your fosters, or make more toys for the toy box.\nThank you for being an awesome volunteer and foster, Caroline!\nAll of our Fosters and Volunteers are Rock Stars, but some just truly embrace it!\nHow long have you volunteered with RPM?\nI’ve been fostering for RPM since May of 2015. We moved to Houston in October of 2014.\nMy friend Debbie introduced me to Peggy Wallace, who is very involved in RPM, before I even moved to Houston. She said “If you ever move to Houston I’m going to hook you up with an amazing rescue”. A year later we were living in Houston.\nWhat made you want to volunteer with RPM?\nI needed to get back into rescue and helping dogs and I’d heard so many good things about RPM and I loved the fact that they did things a little differently.\nWhat do you do as a volunteer for RPM?\nI foster mostly sick dogs, mangey dogs and orphaned bottle babies.\nWhat has been your favorite memory volunteering with RPM?\nMy favorite memory… there lots of them. Not only saving the lives of some pretty sick dogs but the amazing friendships I have made in this awesome rescue community.\nWhat’s the best part about volunteering with RPM?\nThe best part is: Saving lives. And saving myself. I moved here only knowing a few people. I felt lost. I believe RPM saved me and gave me a purpose while fostering and saving lives.\nWhat’s the most difficult part about volunteering with RPM?\nThe most difficult part for me is seeing how much pain and suffering so many of these dogs have been through before being saved by RPM. But the flip side is the joy in watching them heal and blossom.\nWhat’s something you wish you would have known before you started volunteering with RPM?\nI wish I had known I’d be so involved and had moved closer instead of living so far south. If I lived closer I could help at the clinic and help with transporting.\nWhat would you say to those who are considering volunteering with RPM?\nI would tell them to definitely sign up to volunteer. If they can’t foster there are so many other things they can do. Do it for the dogs and do it for yourself. It’s so very rewarding.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T18:28:00Z\",\"url\":\"https://rescuedpetsmovement.org/category/uncategorized/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Saturday 20 April The next meeting in the north west will be held on Saturday 20 April (Easter Saturday), at the home of Brian and Sue Rowney (17 Humber Road, Astley, Tyldesley, Manchester M29 7HL), starting at 2.30 pm. Any offers of material will be welcome – slides (real or digital), DVDs or videos. Please phone 01948 879642 or e-mail bri.rowney@btinternet.com for directions and to advise how many to cater for.\nIt is not a phenomenon unique to transport enthusiast societies that most of the volunteers who do the various jobs running Buses Worldwide (the society) and the heroic work in producing our 3 high quality magazines BBA, BWW and MTN are getting older. Younger people do not appear to join societies in the same numbers as before and this does lead to problems with succession when one incumbent or other has to give up their duties for whatever reason. BWW has appealed before for members to come forward to fill various posts and has had some success but is still looking for more people to put themselves forward to take on jobs or assist current incumbents with the idea of learning what has to be done to ensure continuity if that incumbent needs to give up due to age, incapacity, death or some change in their circumstances. We need people to learn these jobs and if we do not find them, we may not be able to continue to produce the magazines which members tell us that they value highly. As an example, we have had difficulties regarding the production of BWW. These are not yet fully resolved beyond the end of 2018, though we hope we might have a solution. At present production of the features half and the news half of the magazine are carried out by two people, Richard Stedall and David Stevenson.\nWhat we need are assistants to news, features and production editors and publicity officer. There are presently 2 unfilled places on the Management Committee, which we would like to fill at the coming AGM on 19th May and would welcome nominations. Anyone putting themselves forward might consider if they might want to do any of these jobs or any other post on the committee for that matter. We would like to fill other jobs, which we would like to do if we had volunteers, as part of the committee or not. If you feel you might like to help, I urge you to do so please and to help maintain the society and our 3 magazines at the present high level or even better than they are now. Location anywhere in the world is no problem as email and skype can easily keep us in touch. Please don’t wait for others to come forward but volunteer yourself if you have the time and inclination to do so. Get in touch with me at secretary@busesworldwide.org or any of the other officers listed in the magazines in you can help us to keep things running smoothly. Thank you.\nThe sales stand will be at the Alton Bus rally on the 15th July and the Buses Festival, Gaydon on 19th August. If any members can assist for an hour or more please let the secretary know.\nTo define the Buses Worldwide (BWW) approach to data protection in general and, specifically, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThe information and advice contained herein is based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and is correct to the best of our knowledge, at the time of publication. It remains the member’s responsibility to ensure compliance with the legal requirements of their own particular circumstances, if necessary seeking professional advice.\nFrom 25 May 2018 the Data Protection Act 1998 will be replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation 2018. Whilst this Regulation derives from EU legislation, the UK Government has stated that it will be implemented and carried forward into United Kingdom National Law from March 2019 irrespective of ‘Brexit’. Failure to comply with the regulation may lead to financial penalties.\nAll individuals who give their Personal Data to organisations have the right to determine how it should be used. Organisations collecting personal data, for whatever reason must state the reason why it is being collected and seek the individual’s permission to use it in those ways.\nThis legislation applies to all personal data records either paper or computer based and to all organisations irrespective of whether they are, or need to be, registered with the Information Commissioner.\nKeep the data provided secure.\nWhat the process is for ensuring any information held is up to date. The data held should be the minimum necessary for the organisation to discharge its business.\nThere is nothing in the Regulation which precludes data from being used purely for the administration of the organisation, e.g., sending notification of meetings, or membership renewal falling due, but see section ‘C’ below regarding e-mails.\nIt is a fundamental requirement of the Regulation that the person has to give positive consent as to how their Personal Data is used. Presenting the person with a pre-ticked box for them to untick is not acceptable. They may be presented with a menu to choose from, or boxes they have to complete.\nHaving made their choice, it is their responsibility to vary the permissions; the organisation is under no obligation to seek permission periodically and if statements of preferences, compliant with this Regulation are already held, they may continue to be relied upon.\nThe BWW Permission request wording is shown in Appendix A.\nThe organisation, as Data Controller, has a general duty to ensure the security of all personal data. Whilst BWW is the Data Controller, there needs to be a specific responsibility on one of the BWW Committee Members for data protection. Unless notified elsewhere, this will be the Membership Secretary.\nIt is common practice for some societies to circulate detailed membership lists giving postal and e-mail address amongst their members. For a variety of reasons, BWW has historically chosen to forbid such distribution. Continuing this policy will ease compliance with GDPR.\nWhen the organisation is sending an e-mail to more than one addressee this must be done using the ‘BCC’ address line, unless the owner has specifically consented to their e-mail address being shared with other members.\nAll Committee Members of BWW have given their agreement to their details being publicised, whether in BWW publications, the website or official BWW e-mails.\nThe organisation is required to disclose all data held on an individual should they request it.\nIndividuals have the ‘right to be forgotten’, i.e., the ability to request their details be deleted from wherever held. A process needs to be in place for this.\nIn parallel, data may only be kept for as long as it is required, whether for practical or legal reasons. As such, data deletion processes (e.g., after membership expiry) must be in place.\nAll data held must be accurate (or accurate to the best of the Society’s knowledge in that a member cannot expect us to know of changes without being told!).\nAll personal information, physical or electronic, must be held securely.\nGiven the sensitivity of data stored by the BWW, standard home security should be sufficient. As this may depend on other occupiers, a guide might be to keep the data as secure as your cheque book.\nUse of USB ‘thumb’ drives for electronic data is not recommended due to the ease of loss.\nMost mainstream Cloud storage solutions should be sufficiently secure as long as the access security has been set-up securely (which may not be the default setting of the product).\nBWW does not collect or process Payment Card data, instead using third parties (e.g., PayPal) to process payments. BWW must not process or store Payment Card data as we would then be subject to PCI-DSS (Payment Card Information – Data Security Standard) requirements.\nShould a member give us their card details for a specific transaction, the card details should be thoroughly destroyed after use including any electronic copy. However, members should be actively discouraged from giving this information.\nA member or non-member may provide information (name, address, contact telephone number) to allow the processing of a purchase from BWW. Related financial information must be destroyed once the transaction is known to be complete (e.g., fully delivered and paid for). However, any information which may be required for tax / legal purposes may be kept until completion of the auditing process of the following financial year.\nBuses Worldwide (BWW) will comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.\nE-mail address and contact telephone number.\nPostal and e-mail address and telephone number.\nBWW uses the collected data to administer the organisation and provide services to the members.\nIn addition, the e-mail addresses of the member are used to circulate notices of the digital edition of BWW if the member takes that magazine and has provided an e-mail address.\nBWW’s primary method of contact is by post.\nBWW does not share data outside of the BWW excepting as required for the printing and distribution of BWW, British Buses Abroad and MTN. In this case an edited list is sent, consisting only of a member’s name and address.\nBWW will use best endeavours to ensure data is removed from all e-mail lists, and all other live personal data records held by BWW within 3 months of one year after their resignation, ending or termination of their paid membership, whichever is the latest, excepting as may be required for tax / legal purposes.\nSales transaction information will be deleted following completion of the transaction (e.g., item delivered and payment received) excepting as may be required for financial reporting purposes.\nBWW will not collect Payment Card Information. Instead, this will be processed by third-parties (e.g., PayPal on the BWW website) on our behalf. Members will be discouraged form sending such information to BWW, being directed to the BWW website.\nEvery member has the right to instruct BWW on how their personal data is used. On joining, each member will be asked for their information and be able to note which ways they may be contacted. The form will also explain how the data will be used.\nThis form is also available on the Members Area of the BWW website and they may change the permission at any time.\nAdditionally, a member may write to the Company Secretary or Membership Secretary to have their permissions changed.\nIt is the responsibility of the member to ensure that they advise the Membership Secretary promptly of any changes to the data held by BWW.\nBWW will, as part of the membership renewal process, undertake a full check of postal and e-mail addresses and telephone numbers of all members against the completed Renewal Form.\nHard copy and electronic data must be stored securely. Given the sensitivity of data stored by the BWW standard home security should be sufficient for physical information and electronic storage mediums (e.g., external drives) including PCs.\nThis data must not be stored in a website (BWW or otherwise).\nIf Cloud storage solutions are used they must be configured securely to prevent unauthorised access (this may not be the default security setting).\nBWW does not have a Data Protection Officer.\nThese guidelines have been drawn up following discussions with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\nUse of data consent wording for membership forms.\nBuses Worldwide (BWW) holds information on all members which is used for the administration of your membership.\nYour Name and Address are required so that we can process your membership and send you copies of our magazines, BWW, British Buses Abroad and MTN.\nYou may also give us your telephone number which would only be used to contact you in case of a query about your membership.\nNo information is passed outside Buses Worldwide, except that your Name and Address will be forwarded to the distributor of BWW and if elected to provide an e-mail address, this will be provided to our Digital magazine supplier for BWW editions only.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T00:50:39Z\",\"url\":\"https://busesworldwide.org/wp/?page_id=251\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

This is much more the story of a still, currently, right now, in this moment, quiet shy and awkward girl finally accepting that it is ok to still, currently, right now, in this moment, be exactly that, quiet shy and awkward.\nWhere do I look when I enter a room full of people? Do I say hi and wave or go up to each individual person? And then there’s the moment where you actually want to engage in conversation but you can’t find a space between other people’s voices so you accidentally cut into someone else’s sentence and then awkwardly drift off and pretend like you didn’t say anything …or is that just me?\nAnd when I did manage to go to a gathering, I would just sit awkwardly in the corner or quietly sit and listen to the group conversation (and yes, I now know this is incredibly weird). But at the time I thought that being around people and acting normal (or what I thought was normal) would, in turn, make me “normal”.\nBut because I was so quiet, and because I tried to insert myself in group settings, I was able to really observe the people around me, and to be blunt, I don’t think that people liked me. Actually, let me rephrase that. People did not like me.\nAnd I think more often than not, people took my shyness as me thinking that I was too good to be part of the group. And maybe this is just a part of the paranoia aspect of having anxiety, but either way, these reactions made me want to crawl even deeper into my shell and never come out.\nStill, to this day, when I walk into a room full of people, whether or not I’ve known the group since I was a kid or if they’re all complete strangers, I look at the ground and just pray to God that no one notices me.\nAs I grew up I discovered that through meeting other people, that social anxiety was pretty common and that I learned to cope through the normalization of it all.\nBut that would be a lie, because as those of you with social anxiety know, talking to someone is one thing, but actually opening up about something personal, is a whole other story.\nSo I hope that through this article, where I am able to somewhat safely hide behind the anonymity of a computer screen (in which I can’t directly observe people’s reactions), that I will be able to reach out to connect with at least one person who is going through the same feelings and experience.\nAnd hopefully, we can find a way to sit awkwardly together in an uncomfortable setting, and feel perfectly normal.\nTerra is a 21 year old Toronto (self-declared) writer.\tRead more articles from Terra on Thought Catalog.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T16:27:52Z\",\"url\":\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/krystal-naval/2017/02/read-this-if-you-struggle-with-social-anxiety-and-feel-terribly-alone/?utm_campaign=related&utm_source=thoughtcatalog&utm_term=krystal-naval\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Designer clothing, flights on a private jet, and glamorous parties – all yours for the price of photo editing apps. Byron Denton, a London-based vlogger began posting photos of himself on Instagram in late January living life as an uber-rich Instagram influencer, but without the actual wealth. The 19-year-old wanted to conduct a social experiment to see how easy it would be to fake a flashy influencer lifestyle to his followers and how they would respond. Turns out social media is one intoxicating drug, not only were people convinced the engagement on his page skyrocketed and all it took was some editing.\nKnown to his Youtube followers as ‘tbhbyron‘ the content creator told Insider he was inspired by fellow YouTuber George Mason, who had faked going on vacation for a week at the beginning of the year. “I saw a lot of people faking holidays and stuff, but I thought it would be cool to take a different approach,” Denton told them.\nAnd according to the results, the answer might be yes. This photo of Denton “lounging in a private jet,” received 1,000 likes in only seven seconds. Talk about the power of clout. But the influencer frenzy was not just limited to high-class experiences but expensive fashion as well.\nIn his YouTube video reveal he said, “I did this to try and compare whether wearing designer items would actually encourage people to like your photos or not, so if we go back to a photo I posted on 1 December, wearing a semi-cute outfit, kinda basic but still kinda cute, this actually ended up getting 2,234 likes, 44 comments, and 113 profile visits,” but then compare that to his new “designer” lifestyle?\nTo the untrained eye, these edited photos look pretty convincing and the vlogger said most people bought it. In his interview, he said he got only about five messages questioning the new influencer life. Even his own family members were shocked at his new lavish choices and commented about his suddenly attained wealth.\n“I had a lot of messages from my friends asking how I was affording all the designer stuff and a lot of comments from my followers asking if I’d won the lottery or something,” said Denton.\nFaking it is the currency of the social media world, it’s even how influencers get their start. Sure these brand advertisers can earn well into the six-figure mark but getting there is no easy feat. Many brand influencers when they are just starting out will fake ads or sponsored posts just to get on the map.\nAn example of “sponcon” is Taylor Evans who faked the purpose of a trip to Miami. The influencer was there on vacation but spun the captions to make it look as though she was on an all-expenses-paid press trip. This type of fake clout can make actually companies want you to represent them.\nSo how did he pull all of this off? The answer is a mixture of several different photo-editing apps: FaceTune, PicsArt, and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom for the finishing touches. Denton explained he would superimpose two images together using FaceTune and PicsArt. The average time for each fake shoot was around 45 minutes from shooting to editing.\nWho on Instagram doesn’t love a good boomerang shot? It’s the little touches that really sell it.\nThe last step, let the likes and comments come flooding in, after all you’re a model now.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T00:52:06Z\",\"url\":\"https://okezone.club/19-year-old-fakes-living-a-luxurious-life-for-an-instagram-experiment-is-surprised-with-how-easy-it-is/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"Jason Fletcher is associate professor of health policy at Yale University and one of the report’s authors.\nThe Texas law that guarantees admission into a public university for students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class “lives up to some of the expectations of its proponents,” but there is little evidence that the law leads to notable increases in diversity.\nThat is one of the key findings of a new study released this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER.\nThe study, titled Tracing the Effects of Guaranteed Admission Through the College Process: Evidence from a Policy Discontinuity in the Texas 10% Plan, also found little evidence that the law leads to “mismatched” students from relatively weak high schools crowding out more “deserving” students from higher quality high schools.\n“The policy may increase diversity — versus having no policy — and does not seem to be bringing students to campus who then struggle and fail out of school,” one of the study’s authors, Jason Fletcher, associate professor of health policy at Yale University, told Diverse.\nFletcher noted that the purpose of the study was not to evaluate the Ten Percent Plan as policy, but rather to compare the decisions, behavior and various outcomes, such as GPA and four-year graduation rates, for students who were barely eligible for the Top Ten Percent plan versus those who were barely ineligible. The study relied upon data from the two flagship universities, UT Austin and Texas A&M University.\n“We find some weak evidence that the 10 percent rule increases minority enrollment at UT, otherwise we cannot detect differences in the characteristics between enrolled students who graduated just inside or just outside the top high school decile,” the study states. “At A&M there is no evidence that students with a prior admissions guarantee perform worse than similar students without guaranteed admission.\nContacted by Diverse for reaction, some experts said the study’s findings are consistent with what other research has found, but that meant different things based on their respective views, and each expert offered caveats with their response.\n“This looks like an interesting, though preliminary, contribution to the literature,” said UCLA law professor Rick Sander, an adherent of mismatch theory, which holds that minority students admitted under race-conscious admissions tend not to fare as well because they are less academically prepared than their peers.\nSander said he was not surprised that the study’s finding of mismatched students under the Ten Percent Plan was small because of the relative similarity between the two studied groups — those just above and those just below the threshold of being in the top 10 percent of their class. The Ten Percent Plan was meant in part to substitute for race-conscious admissions and still broaden diversity.\n“It’s important to note that this is a working paper and has not been peer-reviewed, so one should be cautious about reporting any of its results,” Sander said of the new NBER study.\nsenior fellow at the Century Foundation, had a different take.\n“The authors conclude that the Texas 10 percent plan does not result in much mismatch of students, a conclusion that is consistent with other research findings,” Kahlenberg said.\nFor example, he said, 29 and 6 percent of students admitted under the top 8 percent plan were Hispanic and Black, respectively, compared with 14 and 5 percent in the discretionary admission program.\nSimilarly, he said, 23 percent admitted under the top 8 percent plan were from households making less than $40,000 a year, compared with 10 percent under the discretionary admissions program.\nThe NBER study comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a higher education affirmative action case known as Fisher v. UT Austin. In the case, Abigail Fisher, a White student, claims she was wrongfully denied entry into the Fall 2008 entering class in favor of minority applicants with lesser credentials.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-19T19:33:45Z\",\"url\":\"https://diverseeducation.com/article/50840/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"It’s true for all of us individually, familiarly, and professionally. It is true for medicine – allopathic and alternative - too. It’s true for the knowledge of the disc and the spine it holds. Knowledge of Severna Park back pain keeps evolving, and one of the major milestones was rather recent in the history of man. Back And Neck Care Center discloses past and current discoveries about the disc and the back pain it brings about as well as the Severna Park chiropractic care that reduces that back pain.\nThe knowledge of disc herniation as a compressive force on spinal nerves resulting in back pain and leg pain is a relatively new phenomenon. Keep in mind that the spine changes as it ages. The shape of the disc and the composition of it tissue changes. The disc’s center, nucleus pulposus, changes and gets smaller. (1) We know differently today, but in 1909, the disc herniation was thought to be a tumor. In 1930, a neurologist (T Alajouanine) and surgeon (D Petit-Dutaillis) explained their surgical experiences with disc herniations that were initially studied by a pathologist named CG Schmorl. But it was not until 1934 when WJ Mixter and JS Barr circulated the first report of surgically taking out disc herniations in 19 patients. (2) (Unless it is published, it didn’t happen…and you don’t get credit for it!) So it was less than a century ago that the disc herniation was named a disc herniation and recognized as such! Allopathy and alternative medicine like chiropractic have grown to the challenge in that time.\nAllopathic medicine is usually focused on the disease and tends to focus on symptom-specific treatment (usually pharmacological or invasive) to get rid of the cause of pain. Alternative medicine traditionally centered on a whole-body approach and has a tendency to focus on treatments that stimulate the body’s ability to heal itself (herbal supplements, Reiki, chiropractic, Tai chi, acupuncture, etc.) to reduce pain. (3) Nowadays, integrative medicine is escalating in its appreciation and use of the best of both.\nChiropractic care is all-encompassing care for spine pain conditions. For the disc herniation resulting in low back pain, neck pain, leg pain and/or arm pain, gentle flexion distraction spinal manipulation is relieving. A new study states that horizontal traction was very helpful in producing a significant increase in average lumbar spine disc height and decrease in lumbar lordosis. (4) Such is available with the Cox Technic System of Spinal Pain Management causing long-y axis distraction. Back And Neck Care Center specializes in this treatment. Cox Technic is described as a non-thrust low velocity variable amplitude spinal manipulation that manages low back pain non-pharmacologically. It’s shown to reduce pain in chronic low back pain patients. (5) It reduces intradiscal pressure in the disc to as low as -192mmHg, widens the spinal canal area by 28%, and increases disc height by 17%. (6) Back And Neck Care Center eases back pain due to disc herniation very effectively.\nSchedule a non-surgical Severna Park chiropractic care appointment with Back And Neck Care Center today. Together, we’ll determine where you have been on your back pain journey and make a course of correction and control for its future with the most appropriate treatment possible.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T12:37:36Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.backandneckcarecenter.net/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Severna-Park/spine-articles/severna-park-chiropractic-helps-disc-herniations\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":". . b . .\nOnly one setup clearly differs from the rest by being well balanced: Tawlbwrdd Lewis cross!\nLast edited by Hagbard on Sun May 15, 2016 9:33 am, edited 3 times in total.\nThat was taken from Lewis's 1940 article. In the original article it appears to be a version tidied up for print, rather than a facsimile of the original drawing. Until the National Library of Wales decides to digitise the Peniarth manuscript and put it on line, or one of us can make the trip to Aberystwyth, the exact drawing will have to remain a mystery. Bell shows the board without a central square marking, and the original source doesn't mention any special properties of the square.\nTen starting setups for tawlbwrdd 11x11 was tournament tested, and the Tawlbwrdd Lewis cross 11x11 was found to be the distinctly only well balanced setup with no throne, balance -1.06 ( http://aagenielsen.dk/tawlbwrdd_summary.php ).\nRobert ip Ifan is the original source of information about the Welsh tawlbwrdd, and through F.R.Lewis we learn that ip Ifan describes the board as 11x11 with the only distinguished square being a throne in the center.\nSo it appears that the Welsh Tawlbwrdd 11x11 indeed has a throne, the same as we know that has the Saami Tablut 9x9.\nGiven the choice, the Tablut Lewis cross does appear somewhat \"un-taflic\" with its four double lines uncovered by the attackers. Usually lines uncovered by the attackers are single lines.\n(P.S. At the same time we also learn from the ip Ifan diagram that there exist no such thing as \"attackers' base camps\" as used in the Foteviken tafl).\nLast edited by Hagbard on Fri Mar 03, 2017 10:41 pm, edited 1 time in total.\nTwo more test tournaments of the two Tawlbwrdd setups were done to find a best choice for the World Tafl Federation Championship Tournament 2016 round 1.\nBoth setups were found to work all right, the game balances being -1.13 and -1.17, and both setups gave many good games.\nThis attackers' setup fits well with the ap Ifan text \"... twenty-four men seek to capture him [the king]. These are placed, six in the centre of each side of the board and in the six central positions.\"\nGathering all attackers in edge center blocks and thus leaving eight open lines and maximum empty space in the corners, could make one believe that the defenders can slip through all this open space easily.\nThe test games showed, however, that it's very hard for the defenders (white) to escape. I had a number of games against high rated players, and my experience was that for the defenders the game is very tight and slightly random, meaning that you might be lucky enough to early catch the opponent in a position where his moves can be forced all the rest of the game until white victory, and if you do just one white move differently it all falls apart and white loses.\nWhite's toolbox lacks the Millar Gambit with this setup (attacking f3 ao.), and one player mentioned that he misses it.\nThis defenders' setup fits well with the ap Ifan text \"... a king in the centre and twelve men in the places next to him ...\".\nThis setup allows for the Millar Gambit, and going through the games one finds a lot of interesting and varied game play. This is a game which can take many directions.\nThe two setups could do with further testing, but for now it seems that the Bell setup would be the best choice for the Championship round 1.\n2016-07-03 11:00:22 Tuireann: I think Tawlbwrdd 1 [Bell] creates more interesting games [...] and I have made some pretty unbelievable victories from behind on Tawlbwrdd 2 [Lewis cross] as black.\n2016-07-05 18:51:14 Sigurd: Between Tawlbwrdd Bell & Lewis Cross it's close, but I'll go with Bell at this point. More games of each are needed though. I'm hoping they both hold up.\nMay 22nd, Jarl Herjan on Facebook, photo of a fine tawlbwrdd board 11x11 with throne and no corners, and diamond-Bell setup, just as we recommend it here.\nThis is my new Tawlbwrdd (Welsh Tafl) which I had designed. In addition I have come up with a set of rules for Tawlbwrdd that is in keeeping with its literal translation meaning \"Throw Board\" which suggests the possible use of dice in the game. What I have come up with following my research and playing various versions of Tawlbwrdd is a game that is fun and easy to play with an element of luck and a gamble that would have appealed to Vikings and the Welsh in the early medieval world.\n\"Throw Board\" is an old mistranslation of the word \"Tawlbwrdd\", Tawlbwrdd simply being the wellknown Scandinavian word Tavlbord = Game Board, in my opinion.\nBut in any case Herjan has invented an interesting tawlbwrdd variant. How do one play this game?","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T22:45:10Z\",\"url\":\"http://aagenielsen.dk/hnefataflforum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=25&p=183\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Whitewashed houses, blue windows, small fishing ports, sandy beaches and many windmills - this is the landscape of Paros. This attractive island of the Cyclades had kept its secrets until the beginning of this century when mass tourists discovered it and photos of the island started to appear in magazines and websites. Today photos of the scenic Naoussa port of Paros can be seen in all articles about the Cyclades group.\nParos is located in the middle of the group and it is very close to Naxos. It is connected with daily ferries to the ports of Piraues, Rafina and Lavrio on mainland Greece, and to many other islands of the group so getting on Paros by sea is very easy. There are also links to some of the North Aegean islands (Ikaria, Fourni and Samos) and to the Dodecanese (once or twice a week in the summer). The ferries arrive at the capital Parikia, on the west coast, and the small airport of the island is in the south part. Paros is very well developed for tourists and it offers numerous hotels and places to stay.\nTraveling around Paros is easy. The island has a good road network and almost no highlands, except in the middle. The coastal road encircles the entire island and the distance from the northernmost to the southernmost part of Paros is about 30 km. Parikia, the capital, is the largest settlement of the island but Naoussa is the one that you see on most photos. Naoussa is the old capital of Paros, famous for its picturesque fishing port and old quarter with maze-like streets. It is also a place popular among artists and craftsman, and plenty of shops there sell original hand-made souvenirs and clothes. Other popular seaside villages are Piso Livadi, Aliki and Parasporos. The inner villages are recommended for a walk, especially Lefkes, Marpissa and Kostos.\nParos is very rich in beaches and almost all of them are sandy, with shallow water. There are both organized beaches with beach bars, entertainment and water sports, and more isolated ones where people rarely come. The southwest coast of Paros is known as a kite spot due to the north Meltemi wind, and the long beach of Chrysi Akti (Golden Coast) in the east is popular among surfers.\nThe small island of Antiparos lies just 1 one km off Paros and its southwest coast. It feels like a part of Paros but yet it is a distinct place with its own character. Boats to Antiparos leave from the harbor of Pounta every 20 minutes in the summer. On Antiparos you will find one main village with tavernas, cafes and hotels, and beautiful small coves where you can enjoy privacy on the beach are scattered all over the island. Some small hotels and villas can be found on the beaches, too. The main village is also called Kastro because it was built around the walls of an ancient Venetians castle, the ruins of which can still be seen. Another interesting place on the island are its sea caves (reachable only by boat).","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T00:30:32Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.feelgreece.com/en/paros\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"At the culmination of their undergraduate careers, SUNY New Paltz’s newest Liberal Arts & Sciences graduates received their degrees before an audience of their families, friends, faculty mentors and College staff at the Saturday Undergraduate Commencement Ceremony, on May 20.\nNearly 2,000 total undergraduate degrees were distributed over the course of a two-day Commencement weekend on the New Paltz campus, as students representing the graduating classes of August 2016, December 2016, January 2017, May 2017 and August 2017 took advantage of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to don cap and gown and be formally recognized for their hard work.\nThe participants at the Saturday Ceremony spent their time at New Paltz developing expertise in a wide array of fields and subjects, including psychology, English, digital media and journalism, Black Studies, communication disorders and economics.\nThese newest alumni of SUNY New Paltz hail from diverse backgrounds and are looking ahead to a variety of career, graduate school and life paths, but will forever have this place and this time in common.\n“This ceremony is a centuries-old tradition to formally and joyfully acknowledge the close of one chapter in our graduates’ lives and the beginning of the next,” said President Donald P. Christian. “In a few moments, today’s graduates will no longer be our students. Instead, equipped with the intellectual tools, habits of mind and inquisitive spirit they’ve developed at New Paltz, they are embarking on the next stage of their life’s voyage.\nThe Commencement Address at the Saturday Ceremony was given by New Paltz alumna and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Latin America and the Caribbean Jessica Faieta ’85 (Economics/Business Administration), who shared insights from a truly international career that began when she left her home country of Ecuador to enroll at New Paltz.\n“Some 30 years ago, I was standing in your shoes, on this same lawn, wearing the same cap and gown,” Faieta said. “When I look back, my life and career feels so unexpected – so full of turns and twists, victories, but also many mistakes. Careers are about trial and error, about taking risks, about perseverance, and about taking pride in every small step that you take.\nStudent Speaker and Salutatorian Jonathan Baez ’17 (Communication Disorders) of Monroe, N.Y., offered his peers some valuable perspective before they stepped to the stage to formally accept their degrees.\n“It’s always good to have a plan, and a strong work ethic has rarely betrayed the one who employs it,” Baez said. “But it is important to remember that even the best laid plans may not pan out. Even in those spaces when life doesn’t quite go as you’d like, allow yourself the experience of what comes your way, because a full life is one in which every minute has been thoroughly inhabited.\nIn the anticipatory moments just before the ceremony got underway, a few grads-to-be took a moment to reflect on their time at New Paltz, and gain some perspective on the magnitude of what they have accomplished.\nThe Saturday Ceremony was part of a weekend-long celebration of New Paltz students’ academic fulfillment, as more than 2,500 graduate and undergraduate degree recipients were honored at Commencement ceremonies held on May 19, 20 and 21.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T10:13:37Z\",\"url\":\"https://sites.newpaltz.edu/news/2017/05/new-liberal-arts-sciences-grads-celebrate-at-saturday-commencement-ceremony/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Not all weight loss aids are created equal. But most of them advertise themselves as being the superior choice for weight loss. Lasting weight loss can not be achieved through a quick fix that many of these products promise. The human body just does not work that way. Many of these products also contain substances that can be dangerous, especially through the continued use of them.\nClenbuterol is a substance that is now used as a weight reducing agent in may weight loss products. Clenbuterol was actually developed for use in horses to treat respiratory disorders. On rare occasions doctors have prescribed this substance to humans to treat severe respiratory disorders, but for the most part, Clenbuterol is still not recommended for widespread use among humans because of the many dangers this substance presents.\nClenbuterol stimulates the metabolism and also increases the production of energizing hormones such as adrenaline and endorphins in the body. This does result in the burning of stored fat and a substantial increase in the energy one feels, which is why it has become popular among dieters. However, the rate at which Clenbuterol stimulates the metabolism into burning fat and the higher rate of energizing hormones in the body are not without dangers. Clenbuterol causes such an increase in the metabolic rate that it can overwhelm and even damage the functioning of your metabolism to the point that it can no longer work properly. Your metabolism delivers energy to the systems of your body and if it can not do this, body systems fail. This can cause permanent damage to the body’s systems and can even result in death.\nEnergizing hormones cause your heart to work harder to compensate for the flood of these hormones through the body. Clenbuterol can cause such an increase in these energizing hormones that the heart can become overtaxed resulting in heart distress and heart failure. There is no dispute that energizing hormones feel terrific. Who among us does not like to feel as if we could climb a mountain without becoming out of breath? Or to feel as if we have the energy to not only take care of our responsibilities but to have energy to spare for fun? I am confident that not many of us would turn down feeling more energetic throughout the day, but there are much safer ways to increase energizing hormones in the body, such as through exercise, that do not raise these hormones to such dangerous levels.\nLean muscle tissue, the stuff that powers your muscles is also at risk of being lost through the continued use of Clenbuterol. This results in less of the strong muscles you need to power activities such as lifting, standing, bending, and walking. Weakened body muscles are less able to protect your bones and joints from injuries. When you lose lean muscle tissue, your body becomes weaker in other ways too as your body must find other resources to fuel itself.\nAnyone who says that losing weight is easy is flat out lying. A product such as Clenbuterol can be very tempting to someone looking for an easy way to lose weight, but truthfully, the losing of excess weight is a process that takes time if you really want to lose it. The quick fix to weight loss that many of these products promise is a nightmarish trap of weight losses and weight gains which carries health risks in and of itself. Research the ingredients in any weight loss product thoroughly before deciding to use them. Some weight loss aids can be safe and helpful for weight loss when used for short periods, but you should know what you are putting into your body and the dangers that many of the ingredients used in the products contain.\nA healthy diet, nutritional supplements, and exercise are by far the best, safest, and most effective methods for weight loss.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T01:43:25Z\",\"url\":\"http://personalpowertraining.net/health/dangers-of-clenbuterol/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"What happens to a pension in a Georgia divorce?\nOn behalf of G. Morris Carr, LLC on Thursday, August 9, 2018.\nOther than custody of a minor child, asset division is probably the most contentious issue in any divorce. You and your ex likely don't agree on what is the best or most fair way to split up your possessions. This can lead to protracted battles in court.\nSpouses often fight most furiously over the assets that are worth the most. Many couples focus on the home, which often represents the most significant purchase from the marriage. Another asset that can cause a lot of conflict in a divorce is a pension.\nGeorgia has its own unique approach to divorce, just like every other state. When it comes to splitting up the assets and debts from your marriage, they use the equitable distribution approach. For those unfamiliar with this term, equitable distribution involves looking at the circumstances of each spouse and other factors from the marriage to decide what is fair.\nEquitable does not always mean a 50/50 split, but rather a property division ruling based on the current and likely future circumstances of all parties. Typically, any assets acquired during the marriage, as well as any debts, are subject to division by the court. This includes assets that are only in the name of one spouse, such as a pension.\nThe courts will look at deposits into the pension account that occurred during the marriage. This will include any matching amounts for employers, as this is also compensation earned during the marriage. Amounts accrued prior to the date of marriage may be exempt from division.\nIn the case of standard retirement accounts, the court can simply issue a special order that requires the division of the retirement account. When it comes to pensions, however, it is often a benefit managed by an employer after retirement. In other words, there isn't an account to split at this time.\nThe courts may need to be creative with how they handle a pension. In some cases, they may award other assets worth roughly the amount that the spouse who doesn't have a pension would receive. Other times, they may order spousal support equivalent to the appropriate percentage of the pension once it begins paying out.\nIf you have a pension account, you should expect to share it with your spouse in a divorce or give away other assets to offset its value. If your spouse has a significant pension, you should seek a fair share of that account. In general, both spouses can expect to receive an equitable amount of the pension, as well as all other assets in a Georgia divorce.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T08:41:40Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.carrdowney.com/blog/2018/08/what-happens-to-a-pension-in-a-georgia-divorce.shtml\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

We are conduits of God's grace to others.

He wasn't crazy. He was a hero-a father who'd risked his life to rescue his son.\n..tithing isn't something I do to clear my conscience so I can do whatever I want with the 90 percent-it also belongs to God! I must seek his direction and permission for whatever I do with the full amount. I may discover that God has different ideas than I do.\nGiven our abundance, the burden of proof should always be on keeping, not giving. Why would you not give? We err by beginning with the assumption that we should keep or spend the money God entrusts to us. Giving should be the default choice. Unless there is a compelling reason to spend it or keep it, we should give it.\nGod doesn't make us rich so we can indulge ourselves and spoil our children, or so we can insulate ourselves form needing God's provision. God gives us abundant material blessing so that we can give it away, and give it generously.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T09:01:02Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.bestquotes4ever.com/authors/randy-alcorn-quotes\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"After leading the Baltimore Ravens to a victory in his first career NFL start a week ago, rookie signal-caller Lamar Jackson will look for a duplicate performance when the Baltimore Ravens host the Oakland Raiders in an intriguing Week 12 matchup. If you’re looking to find out whether Jackson and the Ravens can cover the chalk as a double-digit home favorite or whether Carr and the lowly Oakland Raiders are the pick to either win outright or cover the chalk, let’s get to my Week 12 expert NFL pick right now.\nWhy should you bet on the Raiders in Week 12? Well, there’s the fact that the Raiders are feeling good coming into this contest off of just their second win of the season the last time out. Oakland managed to get past Arizona 23-21 last weekend as Derek Carr passed for 192 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions and Oakland’s defense picked off Jared Goff twice to thwart three TD passes by Arizona’s prized rookie signal-caller.\nAnother good reason to back the Raiders in this contest is that they’re playing against a rookie quarterback that hasn’t shown he can throw the ball consistently in the NFL. Last but not least, a good reason to back Oakland I that they’re getting 10 points against a Ravens team that isn’t very explosive offensively.\nWhy should you bet on the Ravens in Week 12? Well, Baltimore is playing at home where they’re a lot more difficult to bet than on the road. Another good reason is that the Ravens are also coming into this contest with a bit of momentum after beating Cincinnati 24-21 in their Week 11 AFC North divisional battle. Rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson made his first career start in place of the injured Joe Flacco and rushed a whopping 27 times for 117 yards while running back Gus Edwards rushed 17 times for 115 yards and one score.\nAnother great reason to back Baltimore in this matchup is that the Ravens are far superior to the Raiders defensively in allowing 11.2 fewer points per game than Oakland on that side of the ball. Baltimore also has the higher scoring offense in this matchup by 6.7 points per contest. Last but not least, the Ravens have a ton of motivation as they look to hold on to their still-legitimate playoff hopes.\nLet me get started by saying that the double digit point spread for this contest makes the choice for this contest look more challenging than it actually is going to turn out to be. Basically, Baltimore is far superior to Oakland in all three phases, plus they’re playing at home and have a ton to play for.\nThe Raiders rank a pitiful 30th in scoring (17.0 ppg) and the 23 points they scored on Arizona was their third highest point total of the season following consecutive performances of putting six points or less on the board.\nOakland is just 1-4 ATS in their last 5 games against their AFC counterparts, 1-5 ATS in their last 6 games overall and 0-7 ATS in their last 7 games following a straight up win. On the flip side of the coin, Baltimore has gone 3-0-1 ATS in their last 4 games after rushing for more than 150 yards rushing in their previous game while also going 6-1 ATS in their last 7 games in Week 12.\nWith the home team in this series going 6-2 ATS in their last 8 meetings and Oakland going 1-5 ATS in their last six road dates against Baltimore, I say the Ravens win and cover to help Oakland take another step toward getting the top pick in next year’s NFL Draft.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T23:10:27Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/nfl/raiders-vs-ravens-2018-week-12-lines/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Whether you are talking about a breakfast cereal called Corn Flakes or one called Flakes of Corn may not sound a big deal in the human world, but when it comes to exchanging information about products in the supply chain it could mean the difference between getting paid or not.\nGathering product data and maintaining it accurately in a standard format so that it can be used in electronic trade sounds like a no brainer, but product data synchronisation, as its is called, has proved a tough nut to crack.\nFor four years GS1, the European body responsible for bar coding and radio frequency identification (RFID), has been building up a worldwide system for swapping product data called the Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN).\nThe GDSN, which started in August 2004, now consists of 26 local data pools covering 50 countries in which suppliers deposit information about the attributes of their wares according to strict rules. In January this year, GS1 announced it had amassed details of two million products worldwide, twice as many as a year earlier.\nThe data is accessed by retailers and others via a global registry that acts as a kind of telephone exchange, directing calls to the appropriate data pool. Product information – tied to the 14-digit global trade identification number (GTIN) – is used in logistics, accounting and warehouse applications.\nAccurately identifying goods is vital to efficient business transactions. Cash and carry firm Makro, part of the German Metro Group, says it suffers from the fact that over three per cent of its invoices contain invalid GTINs that cause failures in its systems, at a cost of nearly €1m per year.\nMakro has also been experiencing problems with missing or inaccurate product dimensions which resulted in queries on an average 500 orders per year. The company says the errors also cause problems in planning shelves and in warehouse operations.\nThe company has started to use data synchronisation to align supplier product data so that just one description for each item is used in the supply chain. The first step is to carry out data cleansing to eliminate errors from data already stored about products.\nAlthough Makro has not completed the move to data synchronisation, it already sees improvements, according to Philip Steedman, the firm”s e-commerce manager. Introducing new lines used to take a week because of the time involved in gathering information and filling in forms. Now the exercise can be completed in 24 hours with the help of the GDSN.\nHowever, both suppliers and retailers have been slow to adopt synchronisation. One of the reasons is that getting accurate data posted in the pools involves a lot of hard work. Information has to be collected from different parts of a manufacturing organisation and that can be quite labour intensive because individual products must be weighed and measured.\nAnother reason that suppliers have been dragging their feet is that retailers, who call the shots in such matters, have been slow to insist that they put data on the GDSN. This despite the fact that some of the leading lights in supply chain automation including Wal-Mart, Metro and Ahold are committed to synchronisation.\nIn the UK some 1,000 suppliers have joined the network and nine retailers including Boots, Comet and Spar. Originally, GS1 had forecast that there would be 3,000 suppliers and 300,000 products on its books in the UK by the end of 2005. The organisation admits its estimates have been over optimistic.\nSignificantly, Tesco, the UK”s biggest supermarket company, is not a part of the UK data pool. When GDSN was launched in 2005, Tesco”s IT director highlighted the question of data quality. Smaller and medium-sized companies, he said, had not taken steps to address the issue.\nAccurate data is critical to making data synchronisation work, especially when data is used in important business documents such as orders and invoices. Often quoted research by management consultancy AT Kearney revealed some time ago that a third of data in retail catalogues contains errors.\nWhen the company looked at invoices it discovered 60 per cent contained errors because of mistakes in the data used to draw them up. As much of 3.5 per cent of sales are lost each year due to supply chain inefficiencies, AT Kearny concluded. These glitches cost between €60 to €90 to rectify, said the consultancy.\nGS1 is aware of the data quality problem. When it set up its UK operation it contracted a company called Udex to clean up errors such as spelling mistakes, bad punctuation and wrong abbreviations. Product data also suffers from multiple variations of the same product and missing or incorrect weights.\nData pools store data about a minimum 52 aspects of a product such as its weight, dimensions, GTIN and so on. The price of a product is not a compulsory part of the mix, although individual trading partners may exchange price information.\nThe information held in the synchronisation network has many uses. Retailers can use it to learn more about their business. One retailer has looked up information about packaging to estimate the amount of cardboard and plastic waste the company is likely to have to deal with.\nSuppliers adopt data synchronisation to ensure that customers use the right GTINs and to simplify the process of informing customers about new lines. R & R Ice Cream, one of Europe”s largest ice cream makers, says data synchronisation has been a key factor in driving up service levels over the last three years. The company introduces a new product or change to an existing product each day in the fast changing ice cream business. It has to supply customers with details of up to 20 ingredients in a typical product.\nR & R has used the UK data pool to provide more accurate information to customers at a lower cost. ”Because the data we deliver to customers is more accurate and they are using the correct GTINs we see fewer failures and exceptions when getting products listed in our EDI-based ordering and invoicing,” notes Bemrose.\nFor now GS1 is concentrating on the fast moving consumer goods that have been allocated GTINs. The EPC code that is used for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is not included. ”At the moment EPC is not part of the solution because it is not as developed (as GTIN codes),” says Besford.\nHowever, experts point out that synchronisation is also vital to effective use of RFID. ”You can”t use RFID if data synchronisation is not 100 per cent,” says Eddy van Herbruggen, group specialist RFID at services company Zetes. ”I have no doubt it will happen, although that may be some time off.” But for now, GS1 is concentrating on persuading more retailers and suppliers of the business benefits of data synchronisation.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-25T22:11:38Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.logisticsandsupplychain.com/1546-getting-in-sync/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

The atmosphere is great, the progression is very enjoyable and the end result is something I’m definitely going to keep in my playlists for the foreseeable future. Congratulations to Jake and Daniel. You nailed it with this one, guys!\nAurora brings together bits from Progressive, influences from Psy, built around a great melody and introduced as part of a rather non-standard build, to create a really unique sound.\nI know taste is subjective, but quality is not. This here, is absolutely quality, something that’s become a regular thing over at Borderline HQ. Don’t take my word, have a listen to the sample below and hear for yourself.\nFlux BPM Online is the blog featuring reviews, interviews, and events. Dimitri Kechagias wrote his verdict of the latest Daniel’s single, Aurora.\nAt the nearby picturesque city of York is based Activa’s label Borderline Music. The exceptional record label manage to stand out from the crowd and get high placements at the various download shops trance charts. The brand new release is an exceptional mixture of well produced psy trance with heavy doses of acid and magnificent melodic themes running through it. The result is the track Aurora by Daniel Lesden & Mekka. High class composition that can be played on melodic uplifting trance and psy trance sets alike. The psy kick and bassline is present along with various colourful euphoric sunny Ibiza styles synthy themes, airy pads and great atmosphere as well.\nThe track has as a strong asset that it builds slowly and adds strong sound layers until to reach that climax that melodies and rough acid are working together to mesmerise the audience and win its attention. It’s one of those tracks that can capture your imagination and is brave attempt to cross the forbidden boundaries between the two trance camps and bridge their separate worlds. In my opinion many influences in any track can benefit the final result and on this track it’s easy to understand how much the variety of sounds and composition techniques have enhanced the mouthwatering final result that is Aurora. Pure gold, love It!\nA brand new single, collaboration of Mekka and myself, is signed on Borderline Music. Stay tuned for more info and the preview.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T16:29:54Z\",\"url\":\"http://daniellesden.com/blog/tags/aurora/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"This hurricane was one of the most devastating hurricanes in American history, if not the most. This hurricane started out on August 23, 2005 and by the time it was done almost two thousand people were dead and damage estimates could be as high as two hundred billion dollars. In both lives and money, this was one of the most devastating hurricanes for the United States ever. As far as hurricane categories go, Katrina was a five.\nThis hurricane was a category five storm that hit South Florida on August 24, 1992. Winds were clocked at one hundred and sixty five miles per hour, and caused thirty billion dollars in damage at the time. South Florida was devastated, and many buildings and homes were completely demolished. At the time Hurricane Andrew was considered the costliest hurricane ever to hit the USA.\nThis hurricane started in September of 1975, and was responsible for twenty one deaths and more than one billion dollars at the time. Winds reached one hundred and fifty six miles an hour, and this was the first serious hurricane that had managed to affect this area, so it was unexpected.\nPosted on February 27th under Natural Disasters.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-20T12:56:12Z\",\"url\":\"http://www.bionomicfuel.com/top-10-most-devastating-hurricanes-in-american-history-full/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"National traffic safety experts report that drivers who fall asleep at the wheel cause more fatal accidents than drivers that are impaired by alcohol. The demands of job and family on the average person today are largely responsible for the numbers of people risking their lives and the lives of others by driving when sleepy. The dangers of not getting the sleep your body needs is not confined to your safety while driving. Depriving your body of the sleep it needs poses a threat to the functioning of your body, and to your physical and emotional health.\nSuppressed immune systems and an increased susceptibility to illness and disease are dangers of not getting the sleep your body needs that begins to occur with just a few missed hours of the sleep the body needs to function properly. When illness and disease do strike, the body that has not been getting the sleep it needs is less resistant to the affects and stresses that illness and disease place on the body. Recovery from typical illnesses such as colds and flu are prolonged, and survival rates for people suffering from major diseases are significantly lowered when the immune system is not able to function properly because of a serious lacking in the sleep the body needs to power such bodily functions.\nVulnerability to injuries and an overall weakening of the body are further dangers of not getting the sleep your body needs. When the body is weighed down by fatigue, your reactions are slowed and this increases the likelihood for sustaining injuries through falls and not being able to move away from dangers quickly.\nA decrease in mental processes such as thinking and retaining information, focus, decision making, and the state of our emotions are further dangers posed by not getting the sleep your body needs. The sleep deprived body can not power the bodily functions that control these mental processes such as producing the hormones the body uses to regulate emotions and to give the brain the ability to collect, perceive, remember, evaluate, and respond to different information and stimuli to the brain.\nQuite often the stress from the amount of demands the average person faces daily can interfere with being able to go to sleep, or in the ability to sleep through the night to get all of the sleep the body needs. Exercise is a very good way to relieve the stress that can interfere with getting the sleep your body needs. Personal Power Training, www.personalpowertraining.net can help you to find the exercise that can relieve your stress and allow you to get the sleep your body needs. Feel free to look over the numerous exercise and health resources on our website to find what may work best for you.\nHow much sleep your body needs to escape from the dangers of not getting the sleep your body needs may depend on your level of physical activity and the nature of the demands that your job and family place upon you and your stress level as a result of those demands. Experts generally recommend that we get 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night to give our bodies the sleep it needs, but you may find that you need more sleep in order to feel fully rested or that you feel fully rested with only 7 hours of sleep a night. Listen to what your body tells you in how rested you feel with 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Increase your sleeping hours if 7-10 hours of sleep does not help you to wake up feeling fully rested. If you find yourself feeling sleepy throughout the day even with 7 to 10 hours of sleep nightly, for more than a week, consult your doctor.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T02:02:46Z\",\"url\":\"http://personalpowertraining.net/health/the-dangers-of-not-getting-the-sleep-your-body-needs/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Florentino Pérez was so in love with the idea of signing Karim Benzema that he personally travelled to the Frenchman’s house in Lyon to get his signature in a €35m deal. Yet there were some pretty good reasons for the Real Madrid president in wanting to make Benzema one of his three big signings in the summer of 2009 to kick off his second Galactico spell at the club.\nAt that time the then 21-year-old was regarded as one the best young forwards in Europe having scored 37 league goals and 9 Champions League strikes in his final two seasons in France. The problem for Benzema was the huge transition involved in moving from a club and city that was his whole life to the media madness of Real Madrid, a tough challenge for anyone, but especially so for a footballer who is particularly shy and introverted.\nIn Benzema’s first season with Madrid, the forward struggled with the language and with la Liga and only managed eight league goals from 27 appearances with Gonzalo Higuaín the first choice front man with 27 goals for the then Madrid manager, Manuel Pellegrini.\nThe early months under José Mourinho were not much better with the Portuguese a constant critic of his striker’s less than impressive work rate and slacker boy nature seen as too “cold-blooded” by his coach. When Higuaín suffered a back injury last November, Benzema got his chance to show off his undoubted talent as the club’s only striker, although Mourinho was less than pleased with the situation complaining that he was having to go out hunting with a cat, when a dog would have been better.\nThe second half of last season was mixed for Benzema. Whilst the young forward improved his goal tally for Madrid by finishing with 15 in the league, the Frenchman was largely absent in the all important Clásico clashes to leave Benzema claiming in the press that Real Madrid fans had still not seen the best of him.\nMourinho was less than pleased with the situation complaining that he was having to go out hunting with a cat, when a dog would have been better.\nBenzema has all the technical skills required to become a world class striker as he has shown in some performances for both his club and country, with France’s 2-1 win over England in last year’s friendly in mind. Benzema is quick, powerful, inventive and is a wonderful poacher who can bury a chance before his defender is even aware he has the ball. The Frenchman can also play the wide man in a front three as he has occasionally done for Madrid over the past two seasons.\nJust seeing Benzema amble past in the mixed zone after games sums up the problems the striker has in impressing José Mourinho. Laid back, lazy and more than a little sulky is Benzema’s vibe in both in his on and off the pitch demeanor and that is a problem at a club where both the coach and supporters demand blood, sweat and an awful lot of running about in every game and quite simply that isn’t Benzema’s footballing way.\nTechnically, Benzema is better than his striking rival, Higuaín, but it is the Argentinean’s work rate that still sees him as the top dog for The Special One, something that Benzema is beginning to discover as the key element missing from his game.\nThe Frenchman is still adapting to the life and language in Madrid but is beginning to win his battle. Moving to another country and another culture - one where running yourself into the ground for the fans is a requirement - would see Benzema’s progress going back to the beginning.\nExtremely slim. José Mourinho has already said that he has no intention of selling Benzema over the summer and as he is now his own Sporting Director, he can be pretty much held to his word. With Kaká potentially being sold, Florentino Pérez will not be a big fan of losing another one of his prized purchases from 2009, either.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-21T14:33:15Z\",\"url\":\"https://sabotagetimes.com/football/arsenal-karim-benzema-is-a-pussy-cat-rather-than-the-lion-required\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"Let’s face it, after a day of touring beautiful Paris, many visitors long for relief at the hands of a certified massage therapist or spa center. And with numerous Shiatsu, Swedish, and Thai massage parlours to choose from, finding a rub down in a Paris spa is never difficult. But it you seek a happy ending or “body to body” massage in Paris, there seems to be only misleading advertisements and outdated message forums online. But there is much more to the French massage scene than most newcomers realize. In fact the topic of massage has a long and rich tradition in France, as you will soon discover.\nParis Massage Centre offers certified Swedish and Thai therapists.\nThe history of massage in France is well documented, but it’s worth revisiting to help understand the modern landscape of spa salons in Paris. For hundreds of years, the “bone setters” across Europe paved the way for massage therapy. In France in particular, a man named Ambrose Pare’ revolutionized the field in the 16th century through his use of touch with patients. Ambrose developed therapy that proved useful to patients recovering from surgery and relieving localized soreness. As massage became medically accepted in the 19th century around the world, France found itself a leader in massage therapy and even today the salon de massage has a permanent place in French culture.\nSalon de Massage in Paris – A World of Options!\nAs you’ll soon discover, the choices are plenty for those seeking massage therapy or a relaxation spa in Paris. In a Paris hotel spa, you can get lost in luxurious accommodations and posh services. A typical salon near the tourist areas offers quicker, though sometimes high quality massages of varying styles. A professional salon de massage will offer a full line of certified therapists who take their profession seriously and tailor each therapy session to serve the clients’ needs. Of course there’s also the massage erotique – the French term for the “full service” massage which enjoys more popularity than ever these days. One thing is clear – whichever massage type you need, you’ll have no problems finding it in Paris!\nEastern massage salons are becoming popular in Paris.\nThe Swedish massage styles and derivatives are perhaps the most common in France. Paris therapists utilize the long stroke techniques and circular “working” of muscles to relieve tension and provide a relaxing yet therapeutic massage experience for clients. The most common western style of therapy, the Swedish massage is particularly well suited for those suffering from muscle fatigue.\nFast growing in popularity in Paris is the Thai massage. Through stretching muscles and compressing pressure points throughout the body, the Thai therapist enters into cooperation with the client to provide a proper Thai massage. The benefits are many in this style, most importantly to increase flexibility of limbs, restore overall balance, and release blocked energy.\nAcupressure and aromatherapy are often considered alternatives to traditional massage. During an acupressure session, the therapist stimulates meridians along the body with fingers and palms, to release blockages and tension. Aromatherapy uses essential oils like lavender to provide a peaceful atmosphere that reduces stress and gives a feeling of well-being in the clients.\nMassage naturiste salons are common throughout France.\nNo massage in Paris discussion would be complete without the topic of the sensual massage! In fact, this might be the most popular topic among men, who often seek an erotique massage in a Paris hammam, massage spas, and even private apartments. While the masseuses practicing this style of massage are often shunned by professional therapists, there’s no debating the demand for these services.\nWhether you seek a muscle-relieving Swedish therapy session, or desire the balancing result of a Thai massage, you’ll find plenty of suitable salons in Paris. If you decide to broaden your experience, you can try out aromatherapy, acupressure, or even acupuncture or Shiatsu to find what suits you. The fact is, no mater what style of massage in Paris you’re looking for, one fact is certain. There’s no place better for massage options than Paris!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-23T22:36:58Z\",\"url\":\"http://paris-massage.com/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

But you&#39ve been taking in them your entire existence and they are vitally essential to your existence and nicely-remaining. They are a single of the keys to true well being.\nSo, what are they? Phytochemicals are biologically lively substances in food stuff. They have well being boosting talents and probably healing talents. They selection in the hundreds in most plant food items. They are uncovered in fruits, veggies, legumes and grains.\nPhytochemicals operate jointly with vitamins and minerals to encourage well being and avert ailment. When you consume some broccoli or a tomato, you get all of these phytochemicals. So, can not you just consider a nutritional supplement? You could, but very first of all, researchers have isolated only a couple of the phytochemicals in food items. But These operate finest in mixture, so using just a single, isolated phytochemical is not any where around as efficient.\nFor instance, enable&#39s search at lycopene. It is uncovered in tomatoes and is an antioxidant. Anti-oxidants are a significant and essential issue, but for now, enable&#39s just simplify and say that anti-oxidants assistance to restore mobile hurt.\nResearchers did research and uncovered that tomatoes experienced a visible influence in opposition to prostate most cancers. They analyzed the tomato and isolated lycopene. Then the researchers did much more research, making use of lycopene. The influence on prostate most cancers was significantly much less. Does this indicate that lycopene does not operate?\nNo, it signifies that it functions finest in mixture with all the other phytochemicals in tomatoes, and the vitamins and minerals. You do not get that from a chemically similar, but lab-made, lycopene.\nIngesting a emblem is great for you, of training course. But taking in all the tomatoes you would want to get what you want from them would be pretty a process. So, a entire food items powder that I use, Berry Greens, gives freeze dried tomatoes, in a sort that retains the vitamins and minerals. And a entire good deal of other veggies and fruits as nicely. You get all the advantages of taking in all all those fruits and veggies, with no owning to eat all that food stuff.\nMost food items have not been analyzed and even all those that have been, researchers have only been ready to isolate a couple of the phytochemicals. Most veggies have hundreds of phytochemicals, and it&#39s not possible they will all be isolated, analyzed and recognized any time quickly. We do know now, however, that they do operate jointly to supply true well being for us.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-26T06:02:40Z\",\"url\":\"https://healthyfruitandvegetables.com/fruits-and-vegetables-and-phytochemicals/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Thanks to the No. 1 overall pick of Andrew Luck in the 2012 season, the Indianapolis Colts have not only restored the glory and success in the team that was synonymous to Indianapolis in the Peyton Manning era, but they’ve also become perennial postseason contenders, constantly growing from strength to strength with every passing year. In the 2014-15 season, the Colts made a lot of positive strides, finishing the regular season with an 11-5 record, which included a 6-2 home record and a 5-3 road record that saw them pay bettors on the odds to win the AFC South title as well as the OVER season win total lines, as Indianapolis had been pegged for 9.5 wins by the Oddsmakers. During the 2015 playoffs, the Colts had an impressive run, with Luck leading the team to a win over the highly-favored Broncos in the divisional round, before losing controversially to the Patriots in the conference title game. It therefore comes as no surprise that the Colts, comfortable winners of the last two AFC South titles in a row, are strongly favored in the NFL odds to win the 2015-16 AFC South title as well as the NFL odds to win the 2015-16 AFC Conference title. As we continue to wait and prepare for the upcoming NFL season, here is a brief look at the Colts and the value they are likely to offer in the 2015 NFL odds, including free picks for bettors interested in wagering on the early lines.\nThe Colts Own the AFC South!!!\nHouston, Tennessee and Jacksonville fans will probably hate reading this, but the bottom line is that, as long as Luck is Indianapolis, then the AFC South title will always be going to the Colts, unless the trio finds a way of formidably fixing their quarterback woes. After recording a perfect 6-0 sweep against the AFC South opponents in 2013, the Colts were at it again in 2014, going 6-0 in the division. And it has not just been the last two years, as the Colts have gone 16-2 in the three years since Luck signed for the Colts in 2012, with the only losses in the QB’s three-year reign coming against Jacksonville (a 22-17 home loss) and Houston (a 29-17 road loss) in his rookie year. And by looking at the offseason developments in all the four teams, it is a no-brainer that the Colts have been the biggest winners in the division, adding more talent to their already-strong squad. Of course, the Texans have a fighting shot, but with their quarterback problems, it doesn’t look like they’ll have much to offer. Meanwhile, the Jags and Titans are still in a rebuilding mode, so there are no hopes for them in bringing any serious problems against Indianapolis. Needless to say, the Colts should thus be a solid lock to win the AFC South title for the third consecutive time during the 2015 NFL season. FYI, of all the divisions and teams in the league, the Colts are priced as the highest favorites to win their division, underlining the huge expectation by the Oddsmakers on them running the divisional table once again.\nAre the Colts are Playoff-bound in the2015-16 Season?\nDuring the 2014 NFL season, the Colts compiled an impressive 9-3 SU record, good for the second-best regular season mark, alongside New England and Pittsburgh (who both went 9-3 as well), with Denver leading the conference with a 10-2 mark. Considering the earlier mentioned fact that the Colts upset the Broncos in the playoffs and the Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl, it goes without saying that Indianapolis was up there among the best teams in the conference in 2014. And with the constructive changes made to the team (which we will be talking about shortly), the Colts should once again be a formidable force in the conference, both in the regular season and the playoffs. Now, as far as qualifying for the 2016 NFL playoff odds are concerned, there are simply too many reasons for you to bet the Colts as a surefire team to make the postseason cut. Other than their high likelihood to win the AFC South title and earning an automatic entry to the playoffs, it is worth noting that, since the arrival of Andrew Luck in 2012, the Colts are averaging 11 wins per season, with consecutive playoff appearances in his three years at the center. Another double-digit win season (and playoff berth) should thus be in the offing if the trend remains the same. Plus, assuming the Colts once again go 6-0 in the division, it leaves them with the unique advantage of looking to win only 50% of their remaining 10 games of the season to possibly reach the playoffs. And after going 5-5 in the 2014 non-divisional games for a 50% winning record (and doing so with a weaker squad), 2015 should see them perform better. So, even if something cosmically wrong happens in 2015 for the Colts not to win the AFC title (which won’t happen anyway), the team should still be able to collect another double-digit win season to progress to the playoffs. Not to mention, the Colts have a favorable 2015 schedule, going against opponents with a combined record of 106-149-1 from 2014 (sporting a spaghetti-soft 0.417 winning percentage), so the “Lucky Years” should be continuing in 2015 for the Colts, with the team qualifying for the playoffs yet again.\nBy now, I believe all of you are convinced enough about the Colts, their odds to win the AFC South title and the team’s chances at reaching the playoffs. But if you still have some shreds of doubt, then this is my last chance to win you over. During this offseason, the Colts alarmingly lost one of its best receivers in Reggie Wayne, putting a lot of questions as to how Luck would go forward without him. Those questions were put to rest when the team signed former University of Miami star Andre Johnson, a proven receiver whose skills were wasting away in Houston’s below-average offensive system. Besides being three years younger than Wayne (thus offering posterity value in the team), Johnson (turning 34 in July) was the best receiver in Houston’s history. So even with his numbers understandably taking a dip in 2014 due to the Texans’ quarterback issues, his 85 catches for 936 yards and three scores were still decent. At Indianapolis, Johnson will working with the explosive WR T.Y. Hilton, which promises great tidings for the Colts’ receiving department. Meanwhile, after Trent Richardson and Dan Herron disappointed in Indy’s backfield last year, the team made a big-money move by stealing veteran running back Frank Gore from San Francisco, who (despite being 32 years) is a solid runner, boasting of at least 1,106 yards in each of his last four seasons. The Colts defensive line, which has probably not been as strong as required over the recent years, also made some renovations, bringing a solid pass rushing linebacker in Trent Cole (85 sacks in his 155 career games). As if all that is not enough for us to designate the Colts as the 2015-16 National Championship winners, the team claimed a good number of talented and highly-rated players from the 2015 NFL draft, giving them a variety of options to work with on both sides of the field. If you combine this improved roster with the already-mentioned factors, you undeniably get a solid Super Bowl 50 contender. As a matter of fact, outside the Packers, the Colts look to be the strongest team to make its case for the upcoming Vince Lombardi Trophy, so be sure to watch out for them.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-22T23:00:04Z\",\"url\":\"https://mybookie.ag/news/nfl/indianapolis-colts-are-the-afc-team-to-beat/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

But before she took the stage the singer honored her late ex-boyfriend Mac Miller.\nBefore her set, Grande blasted Miller’s 2016 song “Dang!”. The gesture didn’t go unnoticed by her fans. Many fans who were at the show or watching a live stream of the concert tweeted how sweet it was that Grande honored her late ex-boyfriend before taking the stage.\nDuring sound check, it was revealed that her songs “Ghostin” and “Imagine” were left off the setlist because they were too heavy for her to perform.\n“Imagine” and “Ghostin” were assumed to be about Miller. Grande and Miller dated from 2016 until 2018. They met in 2013 when they collaborated on the song “The Way” together and were friends ever since. They broke up in Spring 2018.\nSadly, Miller died in September 2018 from a drug overdose. Grande hasn’t spoken publicly about the loss too much. After Miller past, she shared a video of him on her Instagram with a sweet message.\nGrande’s Sweetener World Tour will span 80 concerts and 17 countries.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T19:50:05Z\",\"url\":\"https://collegecandy.com/2019/03/19/ariana-grande-mac-miller-sweetener-tour/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

{"text":"Download Book World War Z Movie Tie In Edition An Oral History Of The Zombie War in PDF format. You can Read Online World War Z Movie Tie In Edition An Oral History Of The Zombie War here in PDF, EPUB, Mobi or Docx formats.\nAn account of the decade-long conflict between humankind and hordes of the predatory undead is told from the perspective of dozens of survivors who describe in their own words the epic human battle for survival.\nThe subject of this book is Shakespeare’s investigation of religious ideas and phenomena that, from the Church’s perspective, range from traditional orthodox belief to radical unorthodoxy. The book is the first to suggest that Shakespeare accommodates both secular and religious readings by embedding them simultaneously within his plays.\nIn his virtuosic new book noted cultural critic Mark Seltzer shows how suspense, as art form and form of life, depicts and shapes the social systems that organize our modern world. Modernity's predicament, Seltzer writes, is a society so hungry for reality that it cannot stop describing itself, and that makes for a world that continuously establishes itself by staging its own conditions. Employing the social theories of Georg Simmel, Erving Goffman, Niklas Luhmann, and Peter Sloterdijk, Seltzer shows how suspense novels, films, and performance art by Patricia Highsmith, Tom McCarthy, Cormac McCarthy, J. G. Ballard, Karl Ove Knausgaard, and others outline how we currently live and reveal the stress-points and mood-systems of the modern epoch. In its focus on social games, depictions of violent and explosive persons, along with its cast of artists, reporters, detectives, and others who observe and report and reenact, the suspense mode creates and recreates modern systems of action and autonomy, and defines the self-turned world's practices and aesthetics. By epitomizing a reflexive, self-legislating, and autonomous world, a suspense art with humans in the systems epoch provides the models and sets the rules for our modern, official world.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-24T02:46:28Z\",\"url\":\"http://www.nwcbooks.com/download/world-war-z-movie-tie-in-edition-an-oral-history-of-the-zombie-war/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}

Great blog and i send hight grade for his work!","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-18T10:15:11Z\",\"url\":\"http://sensualsingapore.blogspot.com/2016/01/schedule-for-2016.html\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
{"text":"It spreads like a wild fire. “It can never happen to me! I can’t get infected; I am protected. I have taken all the precautions necessary not to get infected.” No, we are not talking about a serious disease. We are talking about ransomware. A virus/malware that encrypts not only the data on your computer, but can reach out to any “drive” on your network that you have access to and encrypts that information as well. This encryption holds the data “hostage” with the sole purpose of extorting money from the victim by requesting payment in exchange for the decryption key that will restore their valuable data.\nChances are that you know of a person or business that has suffered a ransomware attack. The virus does not discriminate, an outbreak can occur in small or large businesses, local municipalities (even police departments), school districts and hospitals. In fact, in February 2016, a California hospital (Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center) was hit with ransomware, as a result their network was offline for over a week. That means no access to email, patient data and other critical documentation that affected the daily operations of the hospital. What would the impact be if ransomware hit your business and you had little or no access to critical information for over a week? The global spread and impact of ransomware further indicates this is a pandemic!\nThere are a number of ransomware threats that have become prevalent, including CryptoLocker or CryptoWall. These malwares have been linked to a number of different emails and/or links on websites. No matter how the infection took place, the result is the same, the malware gets downloaded to a PC and will scan all physical and network (logical) drives and encrypt certain file types. The virus can also attack USB thumb drives that are attached to the infected computer along with folders that are mapped to cloud storage solutions (e.g. Dropbox).\nFiles that get encrypted are typically popular data format files including: Microsoft Office, Adobe programs, iTunes or other music players and photo viewers. The files are compromised using a combination of two different encryption schemes; 256-bit AES and 2048-bit RSA. This basically renders the files useless without the decryption key; brute force or other tools cannot break the encryption on these files. When the ransomware has finished encrypting files on the PC, the virus will typically display a screen regarding a payment program that prompts the user to send a ransom payment to decrypt the files.\nA user is then given a limited amount of time to pay the ransom (typically 72 hours) or it will delete the encryption key, making the encrypted files permanently inaccessible. Typically, the ransom must be paid using Bitcoins; an untraceable payment system. Once a payment is made and verified, the victim will then receive the decryption key in order to decrypt the files held for ransom.\nOnce the ransomware virus has infiltrated a computer and a user takes notice, most of the damage has already been done. If a computer is infected with a ransomware virus, first disconnect the computer immediately from any wireless/wired networks. Although there are software tools that can remove the malware from a computer, once files have been encrypted, they cannot be decrypted without the decryption (private) key. Essentially, three options then exist; 1) pay the ransom, 2) restore any encrypted files from the most recent backup, or 3) assuming a good back-up does not exist, chalk this experience to a cyber-incident and format the hard drive to start from scratch (all too often even if the infected computer was “cleaned” from ransomware, remnants of the malware still exist and may cause problems later).\nThe key here is having a useable and viable backup. Many times as a result of a ransomware infection, businesses learn that their backup is not effectively working or not backing up all files. In either situation, the user may have to resort to option 1 or 3; pay the ransom or format their computer resulting in lost/not retrievable files.\nBackup, Backup and Backup – Having a usable and viable backup (not just a copy of files) can substantially mitigate risks and protect your data. Make sure backup is performed daily and that all files are part of this process. Full daily backups will help ensure a smoother process if there is a ransomware attack. Make sure the backup process through a restore is effectively working. Restore files from backup on a monthly or quarterly basis to provide peace of mind.\nDon’t Open Emails From Strangers – One of the most common ways ransomware is transmitted is through email. Try to not open emails from people that you are not familiar with. DO NOT open attachments or click on links that are in non-familiar emails.\nMinimize Network Access – Perform an assessment to determine the level of access to information each user has on the network. As mentioned previously, ransomware can reach beyond the PC it originally encrypted to the files on the network, affecting the entire company. Limiting access to network files will help mitigate these risks.\nPatch, Patch and Patch – Patches to various software (operating systems, firewalls, application software) systems become available on a regular basis. Patches should be applied to the various software solutions your organization uses (weekly or monthly) in order to mitigate risks and give the attackers fewer options for infecting your system(s) with ransomware.\nTrain Employees – More often than not, ransomware infections are a result of an employee accessing an email, opening an attachment or clicking on a link from an unknown source. Train employees on what to look for and how to avoid infected emails and/or websites. This will help mitigate risks with not only ransomware but other types of cyber-related issues (e.g. phishing attacks).\nMaintain An Endpoint Solution – Many of the various virus/malware protection solutions (endpoints) for PCs will detect ransomware and eliminate the threat. Having up-to-date endpoint solutions (similar to patches) is important to ensure that variants of ransomware will be detected and removed. Having different virus/malware solutions on servers, firewalls and PCs can also strengthen the threat detection and removal process.\nWhile we cannot eliminate the threat of ransomware, we can significantly mitigate the risk of an attack, and reduce the potential consequences. Organizations can no longer believe “it can’t happen to me,” because it can and most likely will. Start by understanding where your organization may have some areas of weakness and assessing where improvements can be made in systems, patches, employee training and most importantly in your backup solution.","meta":"{\"timestamp\":\"2019-04-22T18:51:33Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.blumshapiro.com/insights/ransomware-cybersecurity-services-malware-ct-ma-ri/\",\"language\":\"en\",\"source\":\"c4\"}"}
