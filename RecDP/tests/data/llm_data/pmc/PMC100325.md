Background
==========

Health information systems (HIS) provide a scientific and technological framework to gather, manage, and interpret data to inform the public, policymakers, administrators, and health-care workers about the distribution and determinants of health conditions. Further, they can (and should) guide and measure the impact of interventions \[[@B1]\]. Public health surveillance -- a subset of HIS -- has been defined as *the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for use in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice*\[[@B2]\]. Public health surveillance can be used to 1) assess the overall health status of a population, 2) describe the natural history of disease, 3) monitor disease trends, 4) detect epidemics, 5) evaluate the effect of prevention and control measures, 6) generate hypotheses, and 7) facilitate epidemiologic and laboratory research \[[@B3]\].

Before 1991, the Soviet Union centrally planned the infectious diseases surveillance systems (IDSS) of its 15 republics. Approximately 300 million persons were covered under the IDSS. Central monetary and technical support for the IDSS ended in 1991. As a result, the republics have struggled to maintain their respective IDSS. The former Soviet Union (FSU)-wide diphtheria outbreak in the 1990s \[[@B4]\] and the re-emergence of malaria in Tadjikistan in 1991 \[[@B5]\] and in Armenia \[[@B6]\] and Azerbaijan \[[@B7]\] in 1994 indicated that financial constraints resulting in the disruption of public health infrastructure and services had increased the risk of the re-emergence of infectious diseases \[[@B8]\].

After 1991, this transition to nationalism, privatization, and social reorganization posed new challenges to each republic of the FSU. The loss of centralized training, public health expertise, and resources especially impacted the surveillance systems in each republic. \[[@B9]\] Further, privatization of the FSU medical systems resulted in under-budgeted public health services and inadequately paid personnel \[[@B10]\]. Combined with these infrastructure problems, the increased population migration -- both within the FSU and internationally -- contributed to morbidity and mortality through population dislocation \[[@B8]\]. This has increased the risk of exposure to re-emerging microbial and environmental pathogens and limited access to health services and good nutrition \[[@B9],[@B10]\].

The most important of these changes was the financial crises resulting from the severance of economic ties among all republics of the FSU. Public health officials were challenged to transform the bulky, state-sponsored IDSS. With high inflation and unemployment, they also suffered from shortages of vaccines, hospital supplies, and essential drugs. Provision of basic public health services were compromised, including repairing antiquated water and sewer systems, resulting in increased risk for gastroenteritis and infections with hepatitis A \[[@B11]\]; the largest documented outbreak of typhoid in this century occurred in Tajikistan in February 1997 \[[@B12]\]. Practices such as reusing syringes during vaccination and poor sterilization procedures during dentistry have contributed to nosocomial outbreaks of HIV and a high prevalence of infections with hepatitis B \[[@B13]\].
