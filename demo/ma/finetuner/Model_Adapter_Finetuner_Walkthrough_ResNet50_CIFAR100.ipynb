        "Pretrained models usually are generated by pretraining process, which is training specific model  on specific dataset and has been performed by DE-NAS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or HuggingFace. Finetunner retrieves the pretrained model with same network structure, and copy pretrained weights from pretrained model to corresponding layer of target model, instead of random initialization for target mode. With finetunner, we can greatly improve training speed, and usually achieves better performance.\n",
