        "# Model Adapter Distiller Overview\n",
        "Distiller is based on knowledge distillation technology, it can transfer knowledge from a heavy model (teacher) to a light one (student) with different structure. Teacher is a large model pretrained on specific dataset, which contains sufficient knowledge for this task, while the student model has much smaller structure. Distiller trains the student not only on the dataset, but also with the help of teacher’s knowledge. With distiller, we can take use of the knowledge from the existing pretrained large models but use much less training time. It can also significantly improve the converge speed and predicting accuracy of a small model, which is very helpful for inference.\n",
