As the volume of data available to power these systems grows exponentially, users are increasingly turning from more traditional machine learning methods to highly expressive deep learning models to improve the quality of recommendations. Google's Wide and Deep recommender system is a popular model for recommendation problems for its robustness to signal sparsity.\n",
