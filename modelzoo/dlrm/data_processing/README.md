# DLRM DATA PROCESS (spark/recdp)

### key for correct processing
1. test and valid is splitting 23th days, will have exactly same order as original CSV
2. train will mix 0 - 22 day together, but the original sequence need be maintain. Meaning that combination maybe day0[0-2%]day5[0-2%]day12[0-1%]...day7[99%-100%]day22[99%-100%]
    * reorder records in day will cause dropped auc.
3. Dictionary Generation: In Facebook original version, dictionary is generated by First came first indexing rule, meaning the first key in day0 will be categorified as 0.
